Written with exclusive\n    access to Musk, his family and friends, the book traces the entrepreneur's journey from a rough upbringing in South Africa\n    to the pinnacle of the global business world. Vance spent more than 30 hours in conversation with Musk and interviewed close\n    to 300 people to tell the tumultuous stories of Musk's world-changing companies: PayPal, Tesla Motors, SpaceX and SolarCity,\n    and to characterize a man who has renewed American industry and sparked new levels of innovation while making plenty of enemies\n    along the way.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n    Vance uses Musk's story to explore one of the pressing questions of our time: can the nation of inventors and creators which\n    led the modern world for a century still compete in an age of fierce global competition? He argues that Musk--one of the\n    most unusual and striking figures in American business history--is a contemporary amalgam of legendary inventors and industrialists\n    like Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Howard Hughes, and Steve Jobs.

In 1942, with Nazis occupying Holland, a thirteen-year-old Jewish girl and her family fled their home in Amsterdam and went into hiding. For the next two years, until their whereabouts were betrayed to the Gestapo, they and another family lived cloistered in the \"Secret Annex\" of an old office building. Cut off from the outside world, they faced hunger, boredom, the constant cruelties of living in confined quarters, and the ever-present threat of discovery and death. In her diary Anne Frank recorded vivid impressions of her experiences during this period. By turns thoughtful, moving, and amusing, her account offers a fascinating commentary on human courage and frailty and a compelling self-portrait of a sensitive and spirited young woman whose promise was tragically cut short.<\/p><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

For all that\u2019s been written about the Four over the last two decades, no one has captured their power and staggering success as insightfully as Scott Galloway. Instead of buying the myths these compa\u00adnies broadcast, Galloway asks fundamental questions.<\/p>\n<p>How did the Four infiltrate our lives so completely that they\u2019re almost impossible to avoid (or boycott)? Why does the stock market forgive them for sins that would destroy other firms? And as they race to become the world\u2019s first trillion-dollar company, can anyone chal\u00adlenge them? In the same irreverent style that has made him one of the world\u2019s most celebrated business professors, Galloway deconstructs the strategies of the Four that lurk beneath their shiny veneers.<\/p>\n<p>He shows how they manipulate the fundamental emotional needs that have driven us since our ancestors lived in caves, at a speed and scope others can\u2019t match. And he reveals how you can apply the lessons of their ascent to your own business or career. Whether you want to compete with them, do business with them, or simply live in the world they dominate, you need to understand the Four.<\/p><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Elizabeth Gilbert tells how she made the difficult choice to leave behind all the trappings of modern American success (marriage, house in the country, career) and find, instead, what she truly wanted from life. Setting out for a year to study three different aspects of her nature amid three different cultures, Gilbert explored the art of pleasure in Italy and the art of devotion in India, and then a balance between the two on the Indonesian island of Bali.

What secrets can he teach us?<br \/><br \/>The author of the acclaimed bestsellers\u00a0Steve Jobs,\u00a0Einstein, and\u00a0Benjamin Franklin\u00a0brings Leonardo da Vinci to life in this exciting new biography.<br \/><br \/>Based on thousands of pages from Leonardo\u2019s astonishing notebooks and new discoveries about his life and work, Walter Isaacson weaves a narrative that connects his art to his science. He shows how Leonardo\u2019s genius was based on skills we can improve in ourselves, such as passionate curiosity, careful observation, and an imagination so playful that it flirted with fantasy.<br \/><br \/>He produced the two most famous paintings in history,\u00a0The Last Supper\u00a0and the\u00a0Mona Lisa. But in his own mind, he was just as much a man of science and technology. With a passion that sometimes became obsessive, he pursued innovative studies of anatomy, fossils, birds, the heart, flying machines, botany, geology, and weaponry. His ability to stand at the crossroads of the humanities and the sciences, made iconic by his drawing of\u00a0Vitruvian Man, made him history\u2019s most creative genius.<br \/><br \/>His creativity, like that of other great innovators, came from having wide-ranging passions. He peeled flesh off the faces of cadavers, drew the muscles that move the lips, and then painted history\u2019s most memorable smile. He explored the math of optics, showed how light rays strike the cornea, and produced illusions of changing perspectives in\u00a0The Last Supper. Isaacson also describes how Leonardo\u2019s lifelong enthusiasm for staging theatrical productions informed his paintings and inventions.<br \/><br \/>Leonardo\u2019s delight at combining diverse passions remains the ultimate recipe for creativity. So, too, does his ease at being a bit of a misfit: illegitimate, gay, vegetarian, left-handed, easily distracted, and at times heretical. His life should remind us of the importance of instilling, both in ourselves and our children, not just received knowledge but a willingness to question it\u2014to be imaginative and, like talented misfits and rebels in any era, to think different.<\/p><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

She's in her thirties, she has a husband, a house, they're trying for a baby - and she doesn't want any of it. A bitter divorce and a turbulent love affair later, she emerges battered and bewildered and realizes it is time to pursue her own journey in search of three things she has been missing: pleasure, devotion and balance. So she travels to Rome, where she learns Italian from handsome, brown-eyed identical twins and gains twenty-five pounds, an ashram in India, where she finds that enlightenment entails getting up in the middle of the night to scrub the temple floor, and Bali where a toothless medicine man of indeterminate age offers her a new path to peace: simply sit still and smile. And slowly happiness begins to creep up on her.<\/p><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Knight made the track team and found that not only could he run fast but also, more importantly, he liked it.Ten years later, young and searching, Knight borrowed fifty dollars from his father and launched a company with one simple mission: import high quality running shoes from Japan. Selling the shoes from the trunk of his car to start, he and his gang of friends and runners built one of the most successful brands ever.Phil Knight encountered risks and setbacks along the way, but always followed his own advice. Just keep going. Don't stop. Whatever comes up, don't stop.

Despite the singularity of [Tara Westover's] childhood, the questions her book poses are universal: How much of ourselves should we give to those we love? And how much must we betray them to grow up?\"--Vogue Born to survivalists in the mountains of Idaho, Tara Westover was seventeen the first time she set foot in a classroom. Her family was so isolated from mainstream society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education, and no one to intervene when one of Tara's older brothers became violent. When another brother got himself into college, Tara decided to try a new kind of life. Her quest for knowledge transformed her, taking her over oceans and across continents, to Harvard and to Cambridge University. Only then would she wonder if she'd traveled too far, if there was still a way home.

Bill Gates named Shoe Dog one of his five favorite books of 2016 and called it \"an amazing tale, a refreshingly honest reminder of what the path to business success really looks like. It's a messy, perilous, and chaotic journey, riddled with mistakes, endless struggles, and sacrifice. Phil Knight opens up in ways few CEOs are willing to do.\" Fresh out of business school, Phil Knight borrowed fifty dollars from his father and launched a company with one simple mission: import high-quality, low-cost running shoes from Japan. Selling the shoes from the trunk of his car in 1963, Knight grossed eight thousand dollars that first year. Today, Nike's annual sales top $30 billion. In this age of start-ups, Knight's Nike is the gold standard, and its swoosh is one of the few icons instantly recognized in every corner of the world. But Knight, the man behind the swoosh, has always been a mystery. In Shoe Dog, he tells his story at last. At twenty-four, Knight decides that rather than work for a big corporation, he will create something all his own, new, dynamic, different. He details the many risks he encountered, the crushing setbacks, the ruthless competitors and hostile bankers--as well as his many thrilling triumphs. Above all, he recalls the relationships that formed the heart and soul of Nike, with his former track coach, the irascible and charismatic Bill Bowerman, and with his first employees, a ragtag group of misfits and savants who quickly became a band of swoosh-crazed brothers. Together, harnessing the electrifying power of a bold vision and a shared belief in the transformative power of sports, they created a brand--and a culture--that changed everything.<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Written with exclusive access to Musk, his family and friends, the book traces the entrepreneur's journey from a rough upbringing in South Africa to the pinnacle of the global business world. Vance spent more than 30 hours in conversation with Musk and interviewed close to 300 people to tell the tumultuous stories of Musk's world-changing companies: PayPal, Tesla Motors, SpaceX and SolarCity, and to characterize a man who has renewed American industry and sparked new levels of innovation while making plenty of enemies along the way. <\/span><br \/><span> Vance uses Musk's story to explore one of the pressing questions of our time: can the nation of inventors and creators which led the modern world for a century still compete in an age of fierce global competition? He argues that Musk--one of the most unusual and striking figures in American business history--is a contemporary amalgam of legendary inventors and industrialists like Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Howard Hughes, and Steve Jobs. More than any other entrepreneur today, Musk has dedicated his energies and his own vast fortune to inventing a future that is as rich and far-reaching as the visionaries of the golden age of science-fiction fantasy.<\/span><br \/><br \/><\/span><\/span><\/p><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Visionary. Genius. Dropout. Adopted. Steve Jobs was the founder of Apple and he was all of these things.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Steve Jobs has been described as a showman, artist, tyrant, genius, jerk. Through his life he was loved, hated, admired and dismissed, yet he was a living legend; the genius who founded Apple in his parent's garage when he was just 21 years-old, revolutionising the music world. He single-handedly introduced the first computer that could sit on your desk and founded and nurtured a company called Pixar bringing to life Oscar wining animations Toy Story and Finding Nemo.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So how did the man, who was neither engineer nor computer geek change the world we live in, making us want every product he touched?<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On graduation day in 2005, a fifty-year-old Steve Jobs said: 'Today I want to tell you three stories from my life, That's it. Just three stories'. The first story is about connecting the dots. My second story is about love and loss. My third story is about death.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is his story...<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Critically acclaimed author Karen Blumenthal takes us to the core of this complicated and legendary man, from his adoption and early years through to the pinnacles of his career, his dismissal from his duties at Apple (for being too disruptive and difficult) to the graduation where he gave the commencement speech just 6 years before his death, giving life to what were soon to become some of most famous quotes of his career, ending with the message: \"Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. And I have always wished that for myself. And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you.\"<\/p><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

At last we see him as he was: protean multitasker, decisive, surprisingly willing to forgive his enemies and his errant wife Josephine. Like Churchill, he understood the strategic importance of telling his own story, and his memoirs, dictated from exile on St. Helena, became the single bestselling book of the nineteenth century.<\/p>\n<p>An award-winning historian, Roberts traveled to fifty-three of Napoleon\u2019s sixty battle sites, discovered crucial new documents in archives, and even made the long trip by boat to St. Helena. He is as acute in his understanding of politics as he is of military history. Here at last is a biography worthy of its subject: magisterial, insightful, beautifully written, by one of our foremost historians.<\/p><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Musk wants to save our planet; he wants to send citizens into space, to form a colony on Mars; he wants to make money while doing these things; and he wants us all to know about it. He is the real-life inspiration for the Iron Man series of films starring Robert Downey Junior.<br \/><br \/>The personal tale of Musk\u2019s life comes with all the trappings one associates with a great, drama-filled story. He was a freakishly bright kid who was bullied brutally at school, and abused by his father. In the midst of these rough conditions, and the violence of apartheid South Africa, Musk still thrived academically and attended the University of Pennsylvania, where he paid his own way through school by turning his house into a club and throwing massive parties.<br \/><br \/>He started a pair of huge dot-com successes, including PayPal, which eBay acquired for $1.5 billion in 2002. Musk was forced out as CEO and so began his lost years in which he decided to go it alone and baffled friends by investing his fortune in rockets and electric cars. Meanwhile Musk\u2019s marriage disintegrated as his technological obsessions took over his life ...<br \/><br \/>Elon Musk is the Steve Jobs of the present and the future, and for the past twelve months, he has been shadowed by tech reporter, Ashlee Vance. Elon Musk: How the Billionaire CEO of Spacex and Tesla is Shaping our Future is an important, exciting and intelligent account of the real-life Iron Man.<\/p><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Dear Ijeawele is Adichie's letter of response.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\nHere are fifteen invaluable suggestions-compelling, direct, wryly funny, and perceptive-for how to empower a daughter to become a strong, independent woman. From encouraging her to choose a helicopter, and not only a doll, as a toy if she so desires; having open conversations with her about clothes, makeup, and sexuality; debunking the myth that women are somehow biologically arranged to be in the kitchen making dinner, and that men can \"allow\" women to have full careers, Dear Ijeawele goes right to the heart of sexual politics in the twenty-first century.

How is it, then, that today the former British colonial trading post is a thriving Asian metropolis with not only the world's number one airline, best airport, and busiest port of trade, but also the world's fourthhighest per capita real income?<\/p>\n<p>The story of that transformation is told here by Singapore's charismatic, controversial founding father, Lee Kuan Yew. Rising from a legacy of divisive colonialism, the devastation of the Second World War, and general poverty and disorder following the withdrawal of foreign forces, Singapore now is hailed as a city of the future. This miraculous history is dramatically recounted by the man who not only lived through it all but who fearlessly forged ahead and brought about most of these changes.<\/p>\n<p>Delving deep into his own meticulous notes, as well as previously unpublished government papers and official records, Lee details the extraordinary efforts it took for an island citystate in Southeast Asia to survive at that time.<\/p>\n<p>Lee explains how he and his cabinet colleagues finished off the communist threat to the fledgling state's security and began the arduous process of nation building: forging basic infrastructural roads through a land that still consisted primarily of swamps, creating an army from a hitherto racially and ideologically divided population, stamping out the last vestiges of colonialera corruption, providing mass public housing, and establishing a national airline and airport.<\/p>\n<p>In this illuminating account, Lee writes frankly about his trenchant approach to political opponents and his often unorthodox views on human rights, democracy, and inherited intelligence, aiming always to be correct, not politically correct. Nothing in Singapore escaped his watchful eye: whether choosing shrubs for the greening of the country, restoring the romance of the historic Raffles Hotel, or openly, unabashedly persuading young men to marry women as well educated as themselves. Today's safe, tidy Singapore bears Lee's unmistakable stamp, for which he is unapologetic: If this is a nanny state, I am proud to have fostered one.<\/p>\n<p>Though Lee's domestic canvas in Singapore was small, his vigor and talent assured him a larger place in world affairs. With inimitable style, he brings history to life with cogent analyses of some of the greatest strategic issues of recent times and reveals how, over the years, he navigated the shifting tides of relations among America, China, and Taiwan, acting as confidant, sounding board, and messenger for them. He also includes candid, sometimes acerbic pen portraits of his political peers, including the indomitable Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, the poetryspouting Jiang Zemin, and ideologues George Bush and Deng Xiaoping.<\/p>\n<p>Lee also lifts the veil on his family life and writes tenderly of his wife and stalwart partner, Kwa Geok Choo, and of their pride in their three children particularly the eldest son, Hsien Loong, who is now Singapore's deputy prime minister.<\/p>\n<p>For more than three decades, Lee Kuan Yew has been praised and vilified in equal measure, and he has established himself as a force impossible to ignore in Asian and international politics.

Pham Xuan An's deep cover began in 1957, when the Vietnamese Communist Party sent him to study journalism in California. After an internship at the<em>Sacramento Bee<\/em> and traveling around the U.S., he returned to South Vietnam in 1959. As a reporter for Reuters and\u00a0<em>Time<\/em>, he was privy to classified information that made him a hero in Hanoi after the war. Amiable, fluent in English and adept at explaining Vietnam to Americans and vice versa, he was popular with reporters and officials of both nations. Readers may suspect some of An's recollections are self-serving, but the evidence in his favor is that almost everyone he befriended continued to admire him after learning his role. It's also clear An liked Americans, so much so that superiors suspected his loyalty and confined him to Vietnam after relations thawed. Without glossing over An's responsibility for American deaths, Berman portrays an attractive, sometimes tragic character.\u00a0<em>(May)<\/em><\/div>\r\n<p class=\"productDescriptionSource\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Review<\/span><\/p>\r\n<div class=\"productDescriptionWrapper\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cLarry Berman in his book\u2014insightful, overdue, an authentic \u2018Shock and Awe\u2019 story\u2014deftly humanizes the contradictions in An\u2019s life\u201d (-Bernard Kalb)<br \/><br \/>\u201cBerman has done an excellent job\u2026 There\u2019s plenty here for both supporters and critics of the Vietnam War to ponder.\u201d (Dan Southerland, former correspondent for The Christian Science Monitor in Saigon)<br \/><br \/>\u201cBerman has unraveled the mystery of his strange double life in an engrossing narrative.\u201d (Stanley Karnow, author of Vietnam: A History and winner of the 1991 Pulitzer Prize in history)<br \/><br \/>Praise for NO PEACE NO HONOR \u201cA marvelous piece of work.\u201d (Daniel Ellsberg)<br \/><br \/>Praise for NO PEACE NO HONOR\u201cCarefully researched, authoritative, and highly readable.\u201d (Stanley Karnow, author of Vietnam: A History)<br \/><br \/>Praise for LYNDON JOHNSON\u2019S WAR\u201cA masterful job.\u201d (Marvin Kalb)<br \/><br \/>Praise for LYNDON JOHNSON\u2019S WAR\u201cHighly readable, full of telling quoted from newly opened sources.\u201d (Walter Lafeber)<br \/><br \/>Praise for LYNDON JOHNSON\u2019S WAR\u201cBerman has delivered the coup de grace.\u201d (Townsend Hoopes)<br \/><br \/>\u201cA remarkable blend of biography, history, and personal experience...

None of them ever guessed that he was also providing strategic intelligence to Hanoi, smuggling invisible ink messages into the jungle inside egg rolls. His early reports were so accurate that General Giap joked, \"We are now in the U.S. war room.\"<br \/><br \/>In Perfect Spy, Larry Berman, who An considered his official American biographer, chronicles the extraordinary life of one of the twentieth century's most fascinating spies.<br \/><br \/>From Publishers Weekly<br \/><br \/>Historian Berman (Lyndon Johnson's War) draws on several years of interviews with Pham Xuan An before his death in 2006 for this engaging biography of the Time reporter who spied for North Vietnam throughout the Vietnam War. Pham Xuan An's deep cover began in 1957, when the Vietnamese Communist Party sent him to study journalism in California. After an internship at theSacramento Bee and traveling around the U.S., he returned to South Vietnam in 1959. As a reporter for Reuters and Time, he was privy to classified information that made him a hero in Hanoi after the war. Amiable, fluent in English and adept at explaining Vietnam to Americans and vice versa, he was popular with reporters and officials of both nations. Readers may suspect some of An's recollections are self-serving, but the evidence in his favor is that almost everyone he befriended continued to admire him after learning his role. It's also clear An liked Americans, so much so that superiors suspected his loyalty and confined him to Vietnam after relations thawed. Without glossing over An's responsibility for American deaths, Berman portrays an attractive, sometimes tragic character.

Exquisitely wrought, heartrending and joyous' Joyce Carol Oates<\/p>\n<p>Bill Hayes came to New York in 2009 with a one-way ticket and only the vaguest idea of how he would get by. But, at forty-eight years old, having spent decades in San Francisco, he craved change. Grieving over the death of his partner, he quickly discovered the profound consolations of the city's incessant rhythms, the sight of the Empire State Building against the night sky, and New Yorkers themselves, kindred souls that Hayes, a lifelong insomniac, encountered on late-night strolls with his camera.<\/p> \n<p>And he unexpectedly fell in love again, with his friend and neighbor, the writer and neurologist Oliver Sacks, whose exuberance is captured in funny and touching vignettes throughout. What emerges is a portrait of Sacks at his most personal and endearing, from falling in love for the first time at age seventy-five to facing illness and death (Sacks died of cancer in August 2015). Insomniac City is both a meditation on grief and a celebration of life. Filled with Hayes's distinctive street photos of everyday New Yorkers, the book is a love song to the city and to all who have felt the particular magic and solace it offers.<\/p><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

They said women weren't allowed to go to the market. They said girls couldn't go to school.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raised in a once-peaceful area of Pakistan transformed by terrorism, Malala was taught to stand up for what she believes. So she fought for her right to be educated. And on October 9, 2012, she nearly lost her life for the cause: She was shot point-blank while riding the bus on her way home from school.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">No one expected her to survive.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now Malala is an international symbol of peaceful protest and the youngest ever Nobel Peace Prize winner. In this Young Readers Edition of her bestselling memoir, which has been reimagined specifically for a younger audience and includes exclusive photos and material, we hear firsthand the remarkable story of a girl who knew from a young age that she wanted to change the world -- and did.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Malala's powerful story will open your eyes to another world and will make you believe in hope, truth, miracles and the possibility that one person -- one young person -- can inspire change in her community and beyond.<\/p><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

This book will remind you that you are human\u2014and of the fragile loveliness of being so.\u201d\u2014Lena Dunham<br \/><\/span><\/p><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

He needs a knighthood and his book needs to be in every house.' Adam Kay, author of This is Going to Hurt<br \/>\n<br \/>\nFor more than twenty-five years, David Nott has taken unpaid leave from his job as a general and vascular surgeon with the NHS to volunteer in some of the world's most dangerous war zones. From Sarajevo under siege in 1993, to clandestine hospitals in rebel-held eastern Aleppo, he has carried out life-saving operations and field surgery in the most challenging conditions, and with none of the resources of a major London teaching hospital.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe conflicts he has worked in form a chronology of twenty-first-century combat: Afghanistan, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Darfur, Congo, Iraq, Yemen, Libya, Gaza and Syria. But he has also volunteered in areas blighted by natural disasters, such as the earthquakes in Haiti and Nepal.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nDriven both by compassion and passion, the desire to help others and the thrill of extreme personal danger, he is now widely acknowledged to be the most experienced trauma surgeon in the world. But as time has gone on, David Nott began to realize that flying into to a catastrophe - whether war or natural disaster - was not enough.

Rex and Rose Mary Walls had four children. In the beginning, they lived like nomads, moving among Southwest desert towns, camping in the mountains. Rex was a charismatic, brilliant man who, when sober, captured his children's imagination, teaching them physics, geology, and above all, how to embrace life fearlessly. <\/span><\/p> \n  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span>Rose Mary, who painted and wrote and couldn't stand the responsibility of providing for her family, called herself an \"excitement addict.\" Cooking a meal that would be consumed in fifteen minutes had no appeal when she could make a painting that might last forever. Later, when the money ran out, or the romance of the wandering life faded, the Walls retreated to the dismal West Virginia mining town -- and the family -- Rex Walls had done everything he could to escape. He drank. He stole the grocery money and disappeared for days. As the dysfunction of the family escalated, Jeannette and her brother and sisters had to fend for themselves, supporting one another as they weathered their parents' betrayals and, finally, found the resources and will to leave home. <\/span><\/p> \n  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span>What is so astonishing about Jeannette Walls is not just that she had the guts and tenacity and intelligence to get out, but that she describes her parents with such deep affection and generosity. Hers is a story of triumph against all odds, but also a tender, moving tale of unconditional love in a family that despite its profound flaws gave her the fiery determination to carve out a successful life on her own terms. For two decades, Jeannette Walls hid her roots. Now she tells her own story. A regular contributor to MSNBC, she lives in New York and Long Island and is married to the writer John Taylor.<\/span><\/p><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Walter Isaacson tells the story of the rollercoaster life and searingly intense personality of creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies,music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing.  Although Jobs cooperated with this book, he asked for no control over what was written, nor even the right to read it before it was published. He put nothing off limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. And Jobs speaks candidly, sometimes brutally so, about the people he worked with and competed against.   His friends, foes, and colleagues provide an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted.<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

This is his account of that atrocity: the ever-increasing horrors he endured, the loss of his family and his struggle to survive in a world that stripped him of humanity, dignity and faith. Describing in simple terms the tragic murder of a people from a survivor's perspective, Night is among the most personal, intimate and poignant of all accounts of the Holocaust. A compelling consideration of the darkest side of human nature and the enduring power of hope, it remains one of the most important works of the twentieth century.<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

The lovable pup, who earned the name `Gobi', proved that what she lacked in size, she more than made up for in heart, as she went step for step with Dion over the treacherous Tian Shan Mountains, managing to keep pace with him for nearly 80 miles.<\/p>\n<p>As Dion witnessed the incredible determination of this small animal, he felt something change within himself. In the past he had always focused on winning and being the best, but his goal now was simply to make sure that his new friend was safe, nourished and hydrated.

Facing worldwide scrutiny, Cook (who was often described as shy, unassuming and unimaginative) defied all expectations. Under Cook's leadership Apple has soared: its stock has nearly tripled to become the world's first trillion-dollar company. From the massive growth of the iPhone to new victories like the Apple Watch, Cook is leading Apple to a new era of success. But he's also spearheaded a cultural revolution within the company. Since becoming CEO, Cook has introduced a new style of management that emphasizes kindness, collaboration and honesty, and has quietly pushed Apple to support sexual and racial equal rights and invest heavily in renewable energy. Drawing on authorized access with several Apple insiders, Kahney, the world's leading reporter on Apple, tells the inspiring story of how one man attempted to replace the irreplaceable and succeeded better than anyone thought possible. Leander Kahney has covered Apple for more than a dozen years and has written four popular books about Apple and the culture of its followers, including Inside Steve's Brain and Jony Ive.The former news editor for W, he is currently the editor and publisher of CultofM He lives in San Francisco.<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Krakauer's book, Into the Wild, became an international bestseller, translated into thirty-one languages, and Sean Penn's inspirational film by the same name further skyrocketed Chris McCandless to global fame.<\/p>\n<p>But the real story of Chris's life and his journey has not yet been told - until now. The missing pieces are finally revealed in The Wild Truth, written by Carine McCandless, Chris's beloved and trusted sister.<\/p>\n<p>Featured in both the book and film, Carine has wrestled for more than twenty years with the legacy of her brother's journey to self-discovery, and now tells her own story while filling in the blanks of his. Carine was Chris's best friend, the person with whom he had the closest bond, and who witnessed firsthand the dysfunctional and violent family dynamic that made Chris willing to embrace the harsh wilderness of Alaska.<\/p>\n<p>Growing up in the same troubled household, Carine speaks candidly about the deeper reality of life in the McCandless family. In the many years since the tragedy of Chris's death, Carine has searched for some kind of redemption.<\/p>\n<p>In this touching and deeply personal memoir, she reveals how she has learned that real redemption can only come from speaking the truth.<\/p><\/ul><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Late fees were ubiquitous, video-streaming unheard was of, and widespread DVD adoption seemed about as imminent as flying cars. Indeed, these were the widely accepted laws of the land in 1997, when Marc Randolph had an idea. It was a simple thought-leveraging the internet to rent movies-and was just one of many more and far worse proposals, like personalized baseball bats and a shampoo delivery service, that Randolph would pitch to his business partner, Reed Hastings, on their commute to work each morning.<\/p> \n  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But Hastings was intrigued, and the pair-with Hastings as the primary investor and Randolph as the CEO-founded a company. Now with over 150 million subscribers, Netflix's triumph feels inevitable, but the twenty first century's most disruptive start up began with few believers and calamity at every turn. From having to pitch his own mother on being an early investor, to the motel conference room that served as a first office, to server crashes on launch day, to the now-infamous meeting when Netflix brass pitched Blockbuster to acquire them, Marc Randolph's transformational journey exemplifies how anyone with grit, gut instincts and determination can change the world-even with an idea that many think will never work.<\/p> \n  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What emerges,though, isn't just the inside story of one of the world's most iconic companies. Full of counter-intuitive concepts and written in binge-worthy prose, it answers some of our most fundamental questions about taking that leap of faith in business or in life: How do you begin?

Alibaba, now the world's largest e-commerce company, mostly escaped Western notice for over ten years, while building a customer base larger than Amazon's, and handling the bulk of e-commerce transactions in China. How did it happen? And what was it like to be along for such a revolutionary ride?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In\u00a0Alibaba's World, author Porter Erisman, one of Alibaba's first Western employees, who helped spearhead its international expansion, shows how Jack Ma, a Chinese schoolteacher who twice failed his college entrance exams, rose from obscurity to found Alibaba and lead it from struggling startup to the world's most dominant e-commerce player. Now, in the first English language account of Alibaba's extraordinary success, Erisman shares stories of weathering the dotcom crash, facing down eBay and Google, negotiating with the unpredictable Chinese government, and enduring the misguided advice of foreign experts, all to build the behemoth that's poised to sweep the ecommerce world today. And he analyzes Alibaba's role as a harbinger of the new global business landscape - with its focus on the East rather than the West, emerging markets over developed ones, and the nimble entrepreneur over the industry titan. As we face this near future, the story of Alibaba - and its inevitable descendants - is both essential and instructive.<\/p><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Tech entrepreneurs are society\u2019s chaos monkeys, disruptors testing and transforming every aspect of our lives, from transportation (Uber) and lodging (Airbnb) to television (Netflix) and dating (Tinder). One of Silicon Valley\u2019s most provocative chaos monkeys is Antonio Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez. After stints on Wall Street and as CEO of his own startup, Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez joined Facebook\u2019s nascent advertising team, until he was forced out in the wake of an internal product war over the future of the company\u2019s monetization strategy, and eventually landed at rival Twitter. In Chaos Monkeys, this gleeful contrarian unravels the chaotic evolution of social media and online marketing and lays bare the hijinks, trade secrets, and power plays of the visionaries, grunts, sociopaths, opportunists, accidental tourists, and money cowboys who are revolutionizing our world.<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Condemned for a murder he did not commit, Henri Charriere, nicknamed Papillon, was sent to the penal colony of French Guiana. Forty-two days after his arrival he made his first break for freedom, travelling a thousand gruelling miles in an open boat. He was recaptured and put into solitary confinement but his spirit remained untamed: over thirteen years he made nine incredible escapes, including from the notorious penal colony on Devil's Island.

At twenty-four, he opened the Ferus Gallery with then-unknown artist Edward Kienholz, where he turned the spotlight on a new generation of West Coast artists. Ferus was also the first gallery ever to show Andy Warhol's Campbell's Soup Cans and was shut down by the L.A. vice squad for a show of Wallace Berman's edgy art. At the Pasadena Art Museum in the sixties, Hopps mounted the first museum retrospectives of Marcel Duchamp and Joseph Cornell and the first museum exhibition of Pop Art--before it was even known as Pop Art. In 1967, when Hopps became the director of Washington's Corcoran Gallery of Art at age thirty-four, the New York Times hailed him as \"the most gifted museum man on the West Coast (and, in the field of contemporary art, possibly in the nation).\" He was also arguably the most unpredictable, an eccentric genius who was chronically late. (His staff at the Corcoran had a button made that said WALTER HOPPS WILL BE HERE IN TWENTY MINUTES.) Erratic in his work habits, he was never erratic in his commitment to art.<br \/>Hopps died in 2005, after decades at the Menil Collection of art in Houston for which he was the founding director. A few years before that, he began work on this book. With an introduction by legendary Pop artist Ed Ruscha, The Dream Colony is a vivid, personal, surprising, irreverent, and enlightening account of his life and of some of the greatest artistic minds of the twentieth century.<\/p><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

When twenty-four-year-old Susannah Cahalan woke up alone in a hospital room, strapped to her bed and unable to move or speak, she had no memory of how she'd gotten there. Days earlier, she had been on the threshold of a new, adult life: at the beginning of her first serious relationship and a promising career at a major New York newspaper. Now she was labeled violent, psychotic, a flight risk. What happened?

In the wake of her mother's death, her family scattered and her own marriage was soon destroyed. Four years later, with nothing more to lose, she made the most impulsive decision of her life: to hike the Pacific Crest Trail from the Mojave Desert through California and Oregon to Washington State\u2014and to do it alone. She had no experience as a long-distance hiker, and the trail was little more than \"an idea, vague and outlandish and full of promise.\" But it was a promise of piecing back together a life that had come undone.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Strayed faces down rattlesnakes and black bears, intense heat and record snowfalls, and both the beauty and loneliness of the trail. Told with great suspense and style, sparkling with warmth and humor, Wild vividly captures the terrors and pleasures of one young woman forging ahead against all odds on a journey that maddened, strengthened, and ultimately healed her.<\/p><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Brennan writes with depth and breadth, and she doesn't buy into all the hype. She talks with passion about an idealistic young man who was driven to change the world, about a young father who denied his own child, and about a man who mistook power for love. Chrisann Brennan's intimate memoir provides the reader with a human dimension to Jobs' myth. Finally, a book that reveals the real Steve Jobs.<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Throughout his playing career, he was synonymous with Total Football, a style of play in which every player could play in any position on the pitch. <br \/>\n<br \/>\nToday, his philosophy lives on in teams across Europe, from Barcelona to Bayern Munich and players from Lionel Messi to Cesc Fabrecas. My Turn tells the story of Cruyff's life starting at Ajax, where he won eight national titles and three European Cups before moving to Barcelona where he won La Liga in his first season, in 1973, and was named European Footballer of the Year. <br \/>\n<br \/>\nHe won the Ballon d'Or three times, and led the Dutch national team to the final of the 1974 World Cup, famously losing to West Germany, and receiving the Golden Ball as the player of the tournament. <br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\nWhile on the field Cruyff was in total control, off the field his life was more turbulent with a kidnapping attempt and bankruptcy. <br \/>\n<br \/>\nAfter retiring in 1984, he became a hugely successful manager of Ajax and then Barcelona when he won the Champions league with a young Pep Guardiola in his team. In 1999 Cruyff was voted European Player of the Century, and came second behind Pele in the World Player of the Century poll. <br \/>\n<br \/>\nIn March 2016 Cruyff died after a short battle with lung cancer bringing world football to a standstill in an outpouring of emotions.

It is a roots story on a global scale, a saga of constant movement, frustration and accomplishment, strong women and weak men, hopes lost and deferred, people leaving and being left. Disparate family threads converge in the climactic chapters as Obama reaches adulthood and travels from Honolulu to Los Angeles to New York to Chicago, trying to make sense of his past, establish his own identity, and prepare for his political future.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Barack Obama (The Story)<\/strong> chronicles as never before the forces that shaped the first black president of the United States and explains why he thinks and acts as he does. Much like the author\u2019s classic study of Bill Clinton, First in His Class, this promises to become a seminal book that will redefine a president.<\/p><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Through an institutionalized Twelve-Step Program heavy on Bible study, he was supposed to emerge heterosexual, ex-gay, cleansed of impure urges and stronger in his faith in God for his brush with sin. Instead, even when faced with a harrowing and brutal journey, Garrard found the strength and understanding to break out in search of his true self and forgiveness.\u00a0<br \/>\u00a0<br \/>By confronting his buried past and the burden of a life lived in shadow, Garrard traces the complex relationships among family, faith, and community. At times heart-breaking, at times triumphant, this memoir is a testament to love that survives despite all odds.<\/p><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Deep down, she knows that there's something horribly wrong with her, some defect that her siblings and friends don't have to cope with.Growing up in the 1970s and 80s in New York, Amanda experiences the magic and madness of life through the filter of unrelenting panic. Plagued with fear that her friends and family will be taken from her if she's not watching-that her mother will die, or forget she has children and just move away-Amanda treats every parting as her last. Shuttled between a barefoot bohemian life with her mother in Greenwich Village, and a sanitized, stricter world of affluence uptown with her father, Amanda has little she can depend on. And when Etan Patz disappears down the block from their MacDougal Street home, she can't help but believe that all her worst fears are about to come true.Tenderly delivered and expertly structured, Amanda Stern's memoir is a document of the transformation of New York City and a deep, personal, and comedic account of the trials and errors of seeing life through a very unusual lens.<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

It recounts the author's experiences living in a small house in the woods around Walden Pond near Concord in Massachusetts. Thoreau constructed the house himself, with the help of a few friends, to see if he could live 'deliberately' - independently and apart from society.

Through prose that shifts fluidly between dreams and reality, past and present, and across a landscape of creative aspirations and inspirations, we travel to Frida Kahlo's Casa Azul in Mexico; to a meeting of an Arctic explorer's society in Berlin; to a ramshackle seaside bungalow in New York's Far Rockaway that Smith acquires just before Hurricane Sandy hits; and to the graves of Genet, Plath, Rimbaud and Mishima.\u00a0<br \/><br \/>Woven throughout are reflections on the writer's craft and on artistic creation. Here, too, are singular memories of Smith's life in Michigan and the irremediable loss of her husband, Fred Sonic Smith. Braiding despair with hope and consolation, illustrated with her signature Polaroids,\u00a0M Train\u00a0is a meditation on travel, detective shows, literature and coffee. It is a powerful, deeply moving book by one of the most remarkable artists at work today.<\/p><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Her name was Henrietta Lacks, but scientists know her as HeLa. She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors, yet her cells\u2014taken without her knowledge\u2014became one of the most important tools in medicine. The first \u201cimmortal\u201d human cells grown in culture, they are still alive today, though she has been dead for more than sixty years. If you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown onto a scale, they\u2019d weigh more than 50 million metric tons\u2014as much as a hundred Empire State Buildings. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb\u2019s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions. Yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave. Now Rebecca Skloot takes us on an extraordinary journey, from the \u201ccolored\u201d ward of Johns Hopkins Hospital in the 1950s to stark white laboratories with freezers full of HeLa cells; from Henrietta\u2019s small, dying hometown of Clover, Virginia\u2014a land of wooden slave quarters, faith healings, and voodoo\u2014to East Baltimore today, where her children and grandchildren live and struggle with the legacy of her cells. Henrietta\u2019s family did not learn of her \u201cimmortality\u201d until more than twenty years after her death, when scientists investigating HeLa began using her husband and children in research without informed consent. And though the cells had launched a multimillion-dollar industry that sells human biological materials, her family never saw any of the profits. As Rebecca Skloot so brilliantly shows, the story of the Lacks family\u2014past and present\u2014is inextricably connected to the dark history of experimentation on African Americans, the birth of bioethics, and the legal battles over whether we control the stuff we are made of. Over the decade it took to uncover this story, Rebecca became enmeshed in the lives of the Lacks family\u2014especially Henrietta\u2019s daughter Deborah, who was devastated to learn about her mother\u2019s cells. She was consumed with questions: Had scientists cloned her mother? Did it hurt her when researchers infected her cells with viruses and shot them into space? What happened to her sister, Elsie, who died in a mental institution at the age of fifteen? And if her mother was so important to medicine, why couldn\u2019t her children afford health insurance? Intimate in feeling, astonishing in scope, and impossible to put down, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks captures the beauty and drama of scientific discovery, as well as its human consequences.<\/p><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

But that past has caught up with her. Convicted and sentenced to fifteen months at the infamous federal correctional facility in Danbury, Connecticut, the well-heeled Smith College alumna is now inmate #11187-424--one of the millions of people who disappear \"down the rabbit hole\" of the American penal system. From her first strip search to her final release, Kerman learns to navigate this strange world with its strictly enforced codes of behavior and arbitrary rules. She meets women from all walks of life, who surprise her with small tokens of generosity, hard words of wisdom, and simple acts of acceptance. Heartbreaking, hilarious, and at times enraging, Kerman's story offers a rare look into the lives of women in prison--why it is we lock so many away and what happens to them when they're there. Praise for Orange Is the New Black \"Fascinating . . . The true subject of this unforgettable book is female bonding and the ties that even bars can't unbind.\"--People (four stars)<br \/>\n<br \/>\n\"I loved this book. It's a story rich with humor, pathos, and redemption. What I did not expect from this memoir was the affection, compassion, and even reverence that Piper Kerman demonstrates for all the women she encountered while she was locked away in jail. I will never forget it.\"--Elizabeth Gilbert, author of Eat, Pray, Love<br \/>\n<br \/>\n\"This book is impossible to put down because [Kerman] could be you. Or your best friend.

He emphasises that antigovernment sentiments in the public rarely contribute to a prosperous growth. Conflict between the government and the private sector has given the U.S. a weak economy, growing income inequality, and a decline in its competitive position. Cooperation, he stresses, is more conducive to success than conflict. To Clinton, America \"at its core is an idea - the idea that no matter who you are or where you're from, if you work hard and play by the rules, you'll have the freedom and opportunity to pursue your own dreams.\" Back to Work is an effort to rejuvenate the idea that is America.<\/span><\/p><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Jeanette Walls narrates her nomadic and adventurous childhood with her dreaming, 'brilliant' but alcoholic parents. At the age of seventeen she escapes on a Greyhound bus to New York with her older sister; her younger siblings follow later. After pursuing the education and civilisation her parents sought to escape, Jeanette eventually succeeds in her quest for the 'mundane, middle class existence' she had always craved. In her apartment, overlooked by 'a portrait of someone else's ancestor' she recounts poignant remembered images of star watching with her father, juxtaposed with recollections of irregular meals, accidents and police-car chases and reveals her complex feelings of shame, guilt, pity and pride toward her parents.<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Mostly, though, it hit a nerve among the general public who question the role of Wall Street in society -- and the callous \"take-the-money-and-run\" mentality that brought the world economy to its knees a few short years ago. Smith now picks up where his Op-Ed left off.His story begins in the summer of 2000, when an idealistic 21-year-old arrives as an intern at Goldman Sachs and learns about the firm's Business Principle #1: Our clients' interests always come first. This remains Smith's mantra as he rises from intern to analyst to sales trader, with clients controlling assets of more than a trillion dollars.<\/p>\r\n<p>From the shenanigans of his summer internship during the technology bubble to Las Vegas hot tubs and the excesses of the real estate boom; from the career lifeline he received from an NFL Hall of Famer during the bear market to the day Warren Buffett came to save Goldman Sachs from extinction-Smith will take the reader on his personal journey through the firm, and bring us inside the world's most powerful bank.Smith describes in page-turning detail how the most storied investment bank on Wall Street went from taking iconic companies like Ford, Sears, and Microsoft public to becoming a \"vampire squid\" that referred to its clients as \"muppets\" and paid the government a record half-billion dollars to settle SEC charges. He shows the evolution of Wall Street into an industry riddled with conflicts of interest and a profit-at-all-costs mentality: a perfectly rigged game at the expense of the economy and the society at large. After conversations with nine Goldman Sachs partners over a twelve-month period proved fruitless, Smith came to believe that the only way the system would ever change was for an insider to finally speak out publicly.

In 2013, Sheryl Sandberg\u2019s Lean In became a massive cultural phenomenon and its title became an instant catchphrase for empowering women. The book soared to the top of best-seller lists both nationally and internationally, igniting global conversations about women and ambition.

He adds detail and emotion about his youth in rural Georgia that he described in his magnificent An Hour Before Daylight.<\/p>\n<p>He writes about racism and the isolation of the Carters. He describes the brutality of the hazing regimen at Annapolis, and how he nearly lost his life twice serving on submarines and his amazing interview with Admiral Rickover.<\/p>\n<p>He describes the profound influence his mother had on him, and how he admired his father even though he didn\u2019t emulate him. He admits that he decided to quit the Navy and later enter politics without consulting his wife, Rosalynn, and how appalled he is in retrospect.<\/p>\n<p>In his \u201cwarm and detailed memoir\u201d (Los Angeles Times), Carter tells what he is proud of and what he might do differently. He discusses his regret at losing his re-election, but how he and Rosalynn pushed on and made a new life and second and third rewarding careers. He is frank about the presidents who have succeeded him, world leaders, and his passions for the causes he cares most about, particularly the condition of women and the deprived people of the developing world.<\/p><\/ul><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Annabel Beam spent most of her childhood in and out of hospitals with a rare and incurable digestive disorder that prevented her from living a normal, healthy life. One sunny day when she was able to go outside and play with her sisters, she fell three stories headfirst into an old, hollowed-out tree. Implausibly, she survived without a scratch. While unconscious inside the tree, with rescue workers struggling to get to her, she visited heaven. After being released from the hospital, she defied science and had inexplicably recovered from her chronic ailment. A remarkable family drama and uplifting, hope-filled memoir, Miracles from Heaven will change how we look at the world around us.

This was a young, exciting team full of hope and desire, led by a manager bristling with ambition . . .'Anfield '89. Copenhagen '94. Two of Arsenal's greatest triumphs in the modern era. Both matches defined by the goal-scoring prowess of one man - Alan 'Smudger' Smith.Smith's rise in football was vertiginous: playing for Alvechurch in the Southern League one year, competing in the top flight twelve months later. His first three years at Leicester were characterized by a successful partnership with Gary Lineker. When Lineker left for Everton, Smith stepped forward as the main goal-getter. It was Smith's move to Highbury, however, that enabled him to become the winner of two Golden Boots and one of the most highly-rated strikers in the game.Honest, insightful and authoritative, Heads Up reveals what it was like forging a career in the tough First Division of old before the glitz of the Premier League took hold; the ins and outs of playing for George Graham and rooming with Gazza; the truth behind Anfield '89; which team could easily have gone on to become the first 'Invincibles' had Chelsea not spoiled it one February afternoon; how the highs of the game can quickly be converted into morale-sapping lows; and how injury really does affect a career.After twenty years of writing for the Daily Telegraph, covering four World Cups, four European Championships and countless club games, Alan Smith has done what few ex-professionals are able to do - describe in his own words what it's really like to play the game . . .'Very enjoyable and typically honest account by my old mate on a fine career' Lee Dixon<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

In 1956, Sudan gained Independence from Britain. On the brink of a promising future, it instead descended into civil war and conflict, including the crisis in Darfur that has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and driven many more from their homes. When the 1989 coup brought a hard-line Islamist regime to power, Jamal Mahjoub's family were among those who fled. Almost twenty years later, he returned to a country on the brink of rupture. Rediscovering the city in which his formative years were spent, Mahjoub encounters people and places he left behind. The capital contains the key to understanding Sudan's divided, contradictory nature and while exploring Khartoum's present - its changing identity and shifting moods, its wealthy elite and neglected poor - Mahjoub also delves into the country's troubled history, one turbulent with the rivalry between Christians and Muslims. His search for answers evolves into a thoughtful meditation on the meaning of identity, both personal and national. A Line in the River combines lyrical and evocative memoir with a nuanced exploration of a country's complex history, politics and religion. The result is both captivating and revelatory.<\/p><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Not only is it an important slice of history, from the opposite side of Dispatches and Apocalypse Now, but it shows the diarist - Dang Thuy Tram - as a vibrant human being, full of youthful idealism, a poetic longing for love, trying hard to be worthy of the Communist Party and doing her best to look after her patients under appalling conditions. She wrote straight from the heart and, because of this, her diary has been a huge bestseller in Vietnam - 350,000 copies sold in 2005 alone.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Rider brings the first English translation, in book form, to the Commonwealth markets. But there is more: how the diary came to light is also an unusual story in its own right. Fred Whitehurst was a US intelligence officer on the scene just after Dang Thuy Tram was shot. He came across the diary and, instead of burning it there and then, took it home. His brother translated it and so began an odyssey that took 35 years, to find Thuy Tram's family in Vietnam, and return the small brown book to them.Remarkably, in 2005, Fred Whitehurst tracked down the young doctor's mother who graciously accepted it from this former GI who, as a result, was able to complete his own journey of reconciliation after years of bitterness as a Vietnam vet.<\/p><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

And then Donald Trump happens. In a torpor of despair, she decides that she's had enough of the privileged bubble she's lived in--a bubble within a bubble--and that it's time to make some changes, both in her personal life and in the world at large.<\/p> \n  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At home, she embarks on a year of self-sufficiency--learning how to work the remote, how to pick up dog sh*t, where to find the toaster. She meets her match in an earnest, brainy psychiatrist and enters into therapy, prepared to do the heavy lifting required to look within and make sense of a childhood marked by love and loss and to figure out why people are afraid of her. She becomes politically active--finding her voice as an advocate for change, having difficult conversations, and energizing her base. In the process, she develops a healthy fixation on Special Counsel Robert Mueller and, through unflinching self-reflection and psychological excavation, unearths some glittering truths that light up the road ahead.<\/p> \n  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Thrillingly honest, insightful, and deeply, darkly funny, Chelsea Handler's memoir keeps readers laughing, even as it inspires us to look within and ask ourselves what really matters in our own lives.<\/p> \n  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Advance praise for&nbsp;<\/strong><em><strong>Life Will Be the Death of Me<\/strong><\/em><\/p> \n  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You thought you knew Chelsea Handler--and she thought she knew herself--but in her new book, she discovers that true progress lies in the direction we haven't been.\"<strong>--Gloria Steinem<\/strong><\/p> \n  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I always wondered what it would be like to watch Chelsea Handler in session with her therapist.

It\u2019s also one of the only accounts; incredibly, there has never been an authoritative biography of Lee. Following a decade of research that included conducting more than one hundred interviews with Lee\u2019s family, friends, business associates and even the mistress in whose bed Lee died, Polly has constructed a complex, humane portrait of the icon.<\/p>\n<p>There are his early years as a child star in Hong Kong cinema; his actor father\u2019s struggles with opium addiction and how that turned Bruce into a troublemaking teenager who was kicked out of high school and eventually sent to America to shape up; his beginnings as a martial arts teacher, eventually becoming personal instructor to movie stars like Steve McQueen; his struggles as an Asian-American actor in Hollywood and frustration seeing role after role he auditioned for go to a white actors in eye makeup; his eventual triumph as a leading man; his challenges juggling a sky-rocketing career with his duties as a father and husband; and his shocking end that to this day is still shrouded in mystery.<\/p>\n<p>Polly breaks down the myth of Bruce Lee and argues that, contrary to popular belief, he was an ambitious actor who was obsessed with martial arts\u2014not a great kung-fu master who just so happened to make a couple of movies.

And like Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan before him, LeBron has also become a global brand and businessman who has altered the way professional athletes think about their value, maximize their leverage, and use their voice.LEBRON, INC tells the story of James's journey down the path to becoming a billionaire sports icon - his successes, his failures, and the lessons both have taught him along the way. With plenty of newsmaking tidbits about his rollercoaster last season in Cleveland and high-profile move to the Lakers, LEBRON, INC. shows how James has changed the way most elite athletes manage their careers, and how he launched a movement among his peers that may last decades beyond his playing days.<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Having known her child's father for only three months, she found herself rather suddenly getting to know a newborn, husband, and wholly transformed identity.

These beautiful books make perfect gifts or a treat for any book lover. This edition is edited and introduced by publisher Ursula Doyle.For some of these great men, love is a `delicious poison' (William Congreve); for others, love can scorch like the heat of the sun (Henry VIII), or penetrate the depths of one's heart like a cooling rain (Flaubert). Every shade of love is here, from the exquisite eloquence of Oscar Wilde and the simple devotion of Robert Browning, to the wonderfully modern misery of the Roman Pliny the Younger. Taken together, these Love Letters of Great Men show that perhaps men haven't changed so very much over the last 2,000 years; passion, jealousy, hope and longing are all represented described here - as is the simple pleasure of sending a letter to, and receiving one from, the person you love most.<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Appointed by Ronald Reagan to Chairman of the Federal Reserve, a post he held for eighteen years, he presided over an unprecedented period of stability and low inflation, was revered by economists, adored by investors and consulted by leaders from Beijing to Frankfurt.\u00a0<br \/>Both data-hound and eligible society bachelor, Greenspan was a man of contradictions. His great success was to prove the very idea he, an advocate of the Gold standard, doubted: that the discretionary judgements of a money-printing central bank\u00a0could\u00a0stabilise an economy. He resigned in 2006, having overseen tumultuous changes in the world's most powerful economy. Yet when the great crash happened only two years later many blamed him, even though he had warned early on of irrational exuberance in the market place.\u00a0<br \/>Sebastian Mallaby brilliantly shows the subtlety and complexity of Alan Greenspan's legacy. Full of beautifully rendered high-octane political infighting, hard hitting dialogue and stories,\u00a0The Man Who Knew\u00a0is superbly researched, enormously gripping and the story of the making of modern finance.<\/p><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Many have tried to interpret in words his impact and legacy. Now, Muhammad Ali: A Tribute to the Greatest allows us to more fully appreciate the truth and understand both the man and the ways in which he helped recalibrate how the world perceives its transcendent figures.<\/p>\n<p>In this companion volume to his seminal biography of Ali, New York Times bestselling author Thomas Hauser provides an updated retrospective of Ali\u2019s life. Relying on personal insights, interviews with close associates and other contemporaries of Ali, and memories gathered over the course of decades on the cutting edge of boxing journalism, Hauser explores Ali in detail inside and outside the ring.<\/p>\n<p>Muhammad Ali has attained mythical status. But in recent years, he has been subjected to an image makeover by corporate America as it seeks to homogenise the electrifying nature of his persona. Hauser argues that there has been a deliberate distortion of what Ali believed, said, and stood for, and that making Ali more presentable for advertising purposes by sanitising his legacy is a disservice to history and to Ali himself.<\/p><\/ul><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

We are not born with a fixed amount of resilience. It is a muscle\n    that everyone can build.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n    Option B combines Sheryl\u2019s personal insights with Adam\u2019s eye-opening research on finding strength in the face of adversity.\n    Beginning with the gut-wrenching moment when she finds her husband, Dave Goldberg, collapsed on a gym floor, Sheryl opens\n    up her heart\u2014and her journal\u2014to describe the acute grief and isolation she felt in the wake of his death. But Option B goes\n    beyond Sheryl\u2019s loss to explore how a broad range of people have overcome hardships including illness, job loss, sexual assault,\n    natural disasters, and the violence of war. Their stories reveal the capacity of the human spirit to persevere . . . and\n    to rediscover joy.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n    Resilience comes from deep within us and from support outside us. Even after the most devastating events, it is possible\n    to grow by finding deeper meaning and gaining greater appreciation in our lives. Option B illuminates how to help others\n    in crisis, develop compassion for ourselves, raise strong children, and create resilient families, communities, and workplaces.\n    Many of these lessons can be applied to everyday struggles, allowing us to brave whatever lies ahead. Two weeks after losing\n    her husband, Sheryl was preparing for a father-child activity. \u201cI want Dave,\u201d she cried. Her friend replied, \u201cOption A is\n    not available,\u201d and then promised to help her make the most of Option B.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n    We all live some form of Option B. This book will help us all make the most of it.\n<\/p><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

You may smile as, mentally, you walk alongside Khilnani up some flinty slope. You will keep thinking about what he said long after' Daily TelegraphFor all of India's myths, its sea of stories and moral epics, Indian history remains a curiously unpeopled place. Sunil Khilnani's Incarnations fills that space: recapturing the human dimension of how the world's largest democracy came to be. In this stunningly illustrated and deeply researched book, accompanying his major BBC Radio 4 series, Khilnani explores the lives of 50 Indians, from the spiritualist Buddha to the capitalist Dhirubhai Ambani - lives that light up India's rich, varied past and its continuous ferment of ideas. Khilnani's trenchant portraits of emperors, warriors, philosophers, poets, stars, and corporate titans - some famous, some unjustly forgotten - bring feeling, wry humour, and uncommon insight to social dilemmas that extend from ancient times to our own.As he journeys across the country, and through its past, Khilnani uncovers more than just history. In rocket launches and ayurvedic call centres, in slum temples and Bollywood studios, in California communes and grimy ports, he examines the continued, and often surprising, relevance of the men and women who have made India - and the world - what it is. Their stories will inform, move and entertain this book's many readers.<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

But why--what compels people past pain, lost toenails, 5.30 am start times, The Wall? Sports writer Matt Fitzgerald set out to run eight marathons in eight weeks across the country to answer that question. At each race, he meets an array of runners, from first timers, to dad-daughter teams and spouses, to people who'd been running for decades, and asks them what keeps them running. But there is another deeply personal part to Matt's journey: his own relationship to the sport--and how it helped him overcome his own struggles and cope with his wife Nataki's severe bipolar disorder. A combination of Matt's own How Bad Do You Want It? and What I Talk About When I Talk About Running, Life Is a Marathon captures the magic of those 26.2 miles. At the end of the day--and at the end of the race--the pursuit of a marathon finish line is not unlike the pursuit of happiness. You will pick up the book for a powerful personal story about what running does for the people for whom it does the most. You will put it down with a greater understanding of what it means to be alive in this world.<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

But he was the herd's last chance of survival - dangerous and unpredictable, they would be killed if Anthony wouldn't take them in. As Anthony risked his life to create a bond with the troubled elephants and persuade them to stay on his reserve, he came to realize what a special family they were, from the wise matriarch Nana, who guided the herd, to her warrior sister Frankie, always ready to see off any threat, and their children who fought so hard to survive.<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Hardcover<\/strong><\/p> \n  <p style=\"text-align:justify\">New York Times Bestseller Iconoclastic entrepreneur and New York legend Ken Langone tells the compelling story of how a poor boy from Long Island became one of America's most successful businessmen. Ken Langone has seen it all on his way to a net worth beyond his wildest dreams. A pillar of corporate America for decades, he's a co-founder of Home Depot, a former director of the New York Stock Exchange, and a world-class philanthropist (including $200 million for NYU's Langone Health).<\/p> \n  <p style=\"text-align:justify\">In this memoir he finally tells the story of his unlikely rise and controversial career. It's also a passionate defense of the American Dream -- of preserving a country in which any hungry kid can reach the maximum potential of his or her talents and work ethic. In a series of fascinating stories, Langone shows how he struggled to get an education, break into Wall Street, and scramble for an MBA at night while competing with privileged competitors by day. He shares how he learned how to evaluate what a business is worth and apply his street smarts to 8-figure and 9-figure deals . And he's not shy about discussing, for the first time, his epic legal and PR battle with former NY Governor Eliot Spitzer. His ultimate theme is that free enterprise is the key to giving everyone a leg up.<\/p> \n  <p style=\"text-align:justify\">As he writes: This book is my love song to capitalism. Capitalism works] And I'm living proof -- it works for everybody. Absolutely anybody is entitled to dream big, and absolutely everybody should dream big. I did. Show me where the silver spoon was in my mouth.

This is her most personal memoir yet.<\/p>\n<p>In these pages, she describes what it was like to run against Donald Trump, the mistakes she made, how she has coped with a shocking and devastating loss, and how she found the strength to pick herself back up afterwards.<\/p>\n<p>With humour and candour, she tells readers what it took to get back on her feet - the rituals, relationships and reading that got her through, and what the experience has taught her about life. She speaks about the challenges of being a strong woman in the public eye, the criticism over her voice, age and appearance, and the double standard confronting women in politics.<\/p><\/ul><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

She is warned that her life is in danger; powerful, ruthless men have reasons to want her silenced. But there are things she needs to know, that compel her to press on with her search for the truth.<\/p>\n<p>Was her father an innocent victim? Can she continue to revere the image of him she grew up with, that of a good, loving parent? Or will she be forced to accept that her father was not the person she thought he was?<\/p>\n<p>As the two countries she had considered home reveal themselves as foreign and inimical, Ayesha is forced to confront the tormented issues of identity and belonging. When she travels to Pakistan, Martin Sixsmith goes with her. A shared tragedy and an unlikely friendship lead them both to question the things that give meaning to their lives, and ultimately find solace in the common human values of kindness and respect.<\/p><\/ul><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

A top nightclub promoter in New York City, his life was an endless cycle of drugs, booze, models-repeat. But 10 years in, desperately unhappy and morally bankrupt, he asked himself, \"What would the exact opposite of my life look like?\" Walking away from everything, Harrison spent the next 16 months on a hospital ship in West Africa and discovered his true calling. In 2006, with no money and less than no experience, Harrison founded charity: water. Today, his organization has raised over $300 million to bring clean drinking water to more than 8.2 million people around the globe.<\/p> \n  <p style=\"text-align:justify\">In Thirst, Harrison recounts the twists and turns that built charity: water into one of the most trusted and admired nonprofits in the world. Renowned for its 100% donation model, bold storytelling, imaginative branding, and radical commitment to transparency, charity: water has disrupted how social entrepreneurs work while inspiring millions of people to join its mission of bringing clean water to everyone on the planet within our lifetime.<\/p> \n  <p style=\"text-align:justify\">In the tradition of such bestselling books as Shoe Dog and Mountains Beyond Mountains, Thirst is a riveting account of how to build a better charity, a better business, a better life-and a gritty tale that proves it's never too late to make a change.<\/p> \n  <p style=\"text-align:justify\">100% of the author's net proceeds from Thirst will go to fund charity: water projects around the world.<\/p><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Renowned for his remarkable endurance and speed, accomplished on a vegan diet, he's finished first in nearly all of ultrarunning's elite events over the course of his career. But after two decades of racing, training, speaking, and touring, Jurek felt an urgent need to discover something new about himself. He embarked on a wholly unique challenge, one that would force him to grow as a person and as an athlete: breaking the speed record for the Appalachian Trail. North is the story of the 2,189-mile journey that nearly shattered him.When he set out in the spring of 2015, Jurek anticipated punishing terrain, forbidding weather, and inevitable injuries. He would have to run nearly 50 miles a day, every day, for almost seven weeks. He knew he would be pushing himself to the limit, that comfort and rest would be in short supply - but he couldn't have imagined the physical and emotional toll the trip would exact, nor the rewards it would offer.With his wife, Jenny, friends, and the kindness of strangers supporting him, Jurek ran, hiked, and stumbled his way north, one white blaze at a time. A stunning narrative of perseverance and personal transformation, North is a portrait of a man stripped bare on the most demanding and transcendent effort of his life. It will inspire runners and non-runners alike to keep striving for their personal best.<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Speaker of the House, senator, secretary of state, five-time presidential candidate, and idol to the young Abraham Lincoln, Henry Clay is captured in full at last in this rich and sweeping biography.<\/p>\r\n<p>David S. Heidler and Jeanne T. Heidler present Clay in his early years as a precocious, witty, and optimistic Virginia farm boy who at the age of twenty transformed himself into an attorney. The authors reveal Clay\u2019s tumultuous career in Washington, including his participation in the deadlocked election of 1824 that haunted him for the rest of his career, and shine new light on Clay\u2019s marriage to plain, wealthy Lucretia Hart, a union that lasted fifty-three years and produced eleven children.<\/p>\r\n<p>Featuring an inimitable supporting cast including Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and Abraham Lincoln, Henry Clay is beautifully written and replete with fresh anecdotes and insights. Horse trader and risk taker, arm twister and joke teller, Henry Clay was the consummate politician who gave ground, made deals, and changed the lives of millions.<\/p><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Outnumbered by Al Qaeda fighters, Air Force Combat Controller John Chapman and a handful of SEALs struggled to take the summit in a desperate bid to find a lost teammate. Chapman, leading the charge, was gravely wounded in the initial assault. Believing he was dead, his SEAL leader ordered a retreat. Chapman regained consciousness, alone with the enemy closing in on three sides, beginning the most difficult and exceptional fight of his life.John Chapman's incredible display of valor--first by saving the lives of his SEAL teammates and then, aware that he was mortally wounded, single-handedly engaging two dozen hardened fighters to save the lives of an incoming rescue squad--posthumously earned him the Medal of Honor. Chapman is the first airman in nearly fifty years to be given the distinction reserved for America's greatest heroes.Alone at Dawn is also a behind-the-scenes look at the Air Force Combat Controllers: the world's deadliest and most versatile special operations force, whose members must not only exceed the qualifications of Navy SEAL and Army Delta Force teams, but also act with sharp decisiveness and deft precision--even in the face of life-threatening danger.Drawing from firsthand accounts, classified documents, dramatic video footage, and extensive interviews with leaders and survivors of the operation, Alone at Dawn is the story of an extraordinary man's brave last stand and the brotherhood that forged him<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

But, for much of that time, he was also drinking heavily and eventually admitted in his book Addicted that he was an alcoholic.<\/p>\n<p>Now, in that book\u2019s stunning successor Sober, Adams reveals what happened next. He discusses the impact that Arsene Wenger had when he arrived at Arsenal in 1996, and how the manager\u2019s new methods helped extend his career and brought new success to the club.<\/p>\n<p>Always a great thinker on the game, Adams moved into coaching and management on retirement, playing a key role in Portsmouth\u2019s famous FA Cup triumph in 2008, and taking on new challenges in the Netherlands, Azerbaijan, China and now Spain to broaden his perspective.<\/p>\n<p>He movingly explains the struggles he\u2019s faced to stay sober for twenty years and why he set up Sporting Chance, the charity which provides treatment and support for sports stars suffering from addictions. He gives his incisive thoughts on England\u2019s continued failings in major tournaments and assesses why Arsenal have struggled to repeat the title-winning formula of his own time there.<\/p><\/ul><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

How might our lives unfold alongside those of our parents with Alzheimer's nearby? In Arno Geiger's exquisite memoir, he lets us into the private and sometimes sacred space he found in the company of his father--a relationship nurtured by his own willingness to share a mutual solitude, and to visit those places where his father's spirit was broken and where it thrived.<\/p>\n<p>The tender stories in The Old King in His Exile hold the quiet love between these men, and invite the reader to apprehend more of what it can mean, even in our final days, to be alive.\" --Adrian Nicole Leblanc, author of Random Family: Love, Drugs, Trouble and Coming of Age in the Bronx<\/p>\n<p>Arno Geiger's father was never an easy man to know. Born into a farming family in Austria and conscripted into World War Two as a seventeen-year-old \"schoolboy soldier,\" he was later reticent about the past. When he started to change, Arno assumed it was due to the effects of aging and the breakup of a thirty-year marriage. But it turned out to be more than that.<\/p>\n<p>As Arno Geiger writes in this heartbreaking and insightful memoir of his father's later years, \"Alzheimer's is an illness that, like everything of significance, tells us about a lot more than just itself. Human characteristics and society's mores are enlarged by the illness as if in a magnifying glass.<\/p>\n<p>The world is confusing to all of us, and when you look at it with a clear eye you see that the difference between the healthy and the sick is simply the degree to which they are able to conceal the confusion on the surface.\" Knowing that his father won't ask for help, Arno sets out on a journey to get to know his father at last. Arno remains at his side, listens to his words that are often full of wonderful, unexpected poetry, and discovers that despite everything, his father has not lost his wit, charm, and self-assurance.<\/p><\/ul><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

David Litt was one of those twenty-somethings.<\/p>\n<p>After graduating from college in 2008, he went straight to the Obama campaign. In 2011, he became one of the youngest White House speechwriters in history. Until leaving the White House in 2016, he wrote on topics from healthcare to climate change to criminal justice reform. As President Obama\u2019s go-to comedy writer, he also took the lead on the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner, the so-called \u201cState of the Union of jokes.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Now, in this refreshingly honest memoir, Litt brings us inside Obamaworld. With a humorists\u2019 eye for detail, he describes what it\u2019s like to accidentally trigger an international incident or nearly set a president\u2019s hair aflame.<\/p>\n<p>He answers questions you never knew you had: Which White House men\u2019s room is the classiest? What do you do when the commander in chief gets your name wrong? Where should you never, under any circumstances, change clothes on Air Force One? With nearly a decade of stories to tell, Litt makes clear that politics is completely, hopelessly absurd.<\/p><\/ul><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Now, the greatest angling explorer of his generation returns to delight readers with a book of a different sort, the book he was always destined to write - the distillation of a life spent fishing.As Jeremy's catches attract increasing attention, many people ask him how they can improve their own fishing results. This book is his reply: part science, part art, and part elusive something else - which is within every angler's ability to develop. Along the way you will learn when to let instinct override logic, which details are vital and which may be irrelevant, and how a \"non result\" can be a result.

Yalom puts himself on the couch in a lapidary memoirIrvin D. Yalom has made a career of investigating the lives of others. In this profound memoir, he turns his writing and his therapeutic eye on himself. He opens his story with a nightmare: He is twelve, and is riding his bike past the home of an acne-scarred girl. Like every morning, he calls out, hoping to befriend her, \"Hello Measles!\" But in his dream, the girl's father makes Yalom understand that his daily greeting had hurt her. For Yalom, this was the birth of empathy; he would not forget the lesson. As Becoming Myself unfolds, we see the birth of the insightful thinker whose books have been a beacon to so many. This is not simply a man's life story, Yalom's reflections on his life and development are an invitation for us to reflect on the origins of our own selves and the meanings of our lives.<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Since publishing his searing expose of their criminal activities, the author has received so many death threats from the Camorra that he has been assigned police protection. Known by insiders as'the System', the Camorra, an organized crime network with a global reach and large stakes in construction, high fashion, illicit drugs and toxic-waste disposal, exerts a malign grip on cities and villages along the Neapolitan coast is the deciding factor in why Campania has the highest murder rate in all of Europe and why cancer levels there have skyrocketed in recent years. In pursuit of his subject, Roberto Saviano worked as an assistant at a Chinese textile manufacturer and on a construction site, both controlled by'the System', and as a waiter at a Camorra wedding. Born in Naples, he recalls seeing his first murder at the age of fourteen, and how his own father, a doctor, suffered a brutal beating for trying to help an eighteen-year-old victim, left for dead in the street.<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Women who smash the royal mold have always fascinated the public, from Grace Kelly to Princess Diana. Now acclaimed royal biographer Andrew Morton, the New York Times bestselling author of Diana: Her True Story, brings us a revealing, juicy, and inspiring look at Meghan Markle, the confident and charismatic duchess whose warm and affectionate engagement interview won the hearts of the world. When Meghan Markle and Prince Harry were set up by a mutual friend on a blind date in July 2016, little did they know that the resulting whirlwind romance would lead to their engagement in November 2017 and marriage in May 2018. Morton goes back to Meghan's roots to uncover the story of her childhood growing up in The Valley in Los Angeles, her studies at an all-girls Catholic school, and her fraught family life-a painful experience mirrored by Harry's own background. Morton also delves into her previous marriage and divorce in 2013, her struggles in Hollywood as her mixed heritage was used against her, her big break in the hit TV show Suits, and her work for a humanitarian ambassador-the latter so reminiscent of Princess Diana's passions. Finally, we see how the royal romance played out across two continents but was kept fiercely secret, before the news finally broke and Meghan was thrust into the global media's spotlight. Drawing on exclusive interviews with her family members and closest friends, and including never-before-seen photographs, Morton introduces us to the real Meghan as he reflects on the impact that she has already had on the rigid traditions of the House of Windsor, as well as what the future might hold.<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

On a May afternoon in 1943, an Army Air Forces bomber crashed into the Pacific Ocean and disappeared, leaving only a spray of debris and a slick of oil, gasoline, and blood. Then, on the ocean surface, a face appeared. It was that of a young lieutenant, the plane's bombardier, who was struggling to a life raft and pulling himself aboard. So began one of the most extraordinary odysseys of the Second World War. The lieutenant's name was Louis Zamperini. In boyhood, he'd been a cunning and incorrigible delinquent, breaking into houses, brawling, and fleeing his home to ride the rails. As a teenager, he had channeled his defiance into running, discovering a prodigious talent that had carried him to the Berlin Olympics and within sight of the four-minute mile. But when war had come, the athlete had become an airman, embarking on a journey that led to his doomed flight, a tiny raft, and a drift into the unknown. Ahead of Zamperini lay thousands of miles of open ocean, leaping sharks, a foundering raft, thirst and starvation, enemy aircraft, and, beyond, a trial even greater. Driven to the limits of endurance, Zamperini would answer desperation with ingenuity; suffering with hope, resolve, and humor; brutality with rebellion. His fate, whether triumph or tragedy, would be suspended on the fraying wire of his will. In her long-awaited new book, Laura Hillenbrand writes with the same rich and vivid narrative voice she displayed in Seabiscuit. Telling an unforgettable story of a man's journey into extremity, Unbroken is a testament to the resilience of the human mind, body, and spirit.<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

It was also a land withered by drought and hunger. But William had read about windmills, and he dreamed of building one that would bring to his small village a set of luxuries that only 2 percent of Malawians could enjoy: electricity and running water. His neighbors called him misala--crazy--but William refused to let go of his dreams. With a small pile of once-forgotten science textbooks; some scrap metal, tractor parts, and bicycle halves; and an armory of curiosity and determination, he embarked on a daring plan to forge an unlikely contraption and small miracle that would change the lives around him.<\/p> \n  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind<\/em>&nbsp;is a remarkable true story about human inventiveness and its power to overcome crippling adversity.

It's the snake in her brain that has told her ever since she was a teenager that her world is about to come crashing down: that her family might die if she doesn't repeat a phrase 5 times, or that she might have murdered someone and forgotten about it. It's caused alopecia, bulimia, and drug dependency. And Bryony is sick of it.<br \/>\n Keeping silent about her illness has given it a cachet it simply does not deserve, so here she shares her story with trademark wit and dazzling honesty.<br \/>\n A hugely successful columnist for The Telegraph, a bestselling author, and a happily married mother of an adorable daughter, Bryony has managed to laugh and live well while simultaneously grappling with her illness. Now it's time for her to speak out.

Lee, the founding father of modern Singapore and its prime minister from 1959 to 1990, has honed his wisdom during more than fifty years on the world stage. Almost single-handedly responsible for transforming Singapore into a Western-style economic success, he offers a unique perspective on the geopolitics of East and West. American presidents from Richard Nixon to Barack Obama have welcomed him to the White House; British prime ministers from Margaret Thatcher to Tony Blair have recognized his wisdom; and business leaders from Rupert Murdoch to Rex Tillerson, CEO of Exxon Mobil, have praised his accomplishments. This book gathers key insights from interviews, speeches, and Lee's voluminous published writings and presents them in an engaging question and answer format.<\/p>\n<p>Lee offers his assessment of China's future, asserting, among other things, that \u201cChina will want to share this century as co-equals with the U.S.\u201d He affirms the United States' position as the world's sole superpower but expresses dismay at the vagaries of its political system. He offers strategic advice for dealing with China and goes on to discuss India's future, Islamic terrorism, economic growth, geopolitics and globalization, and democracy. Lee does not pull his punches, offering his unvarnished opinions on multiculturalism, the welfare state, education, and the free market. This little book belongs on the reading list of every world leader\u2014including the one who takes the oath of office on January 20, 2013.<\/p>\n<\/div><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Now free from the constraints of running, Hillary takes you inside the intense personal experience of becoming the first woman nominated for president by a major party in an election marked by rage, sexism, exhilarating highs and infuriating lows, stranger-than-fiction twists, Russian interference, and an opponent who broke all the rules. This is her most personal memoir yet.<\/p>\n<p>In these pages, she describes what it was like to run against Donald Trump, the mistakes she made, how she has coped with a shocking and devastating loss, and how she found the strength to pick herself back up afterward. With humor and candor, she tells readers what it took to get back on her feet--the rituals, relationships, and reading that got her through, and what the experience has taught her about life. She speaks about the challenges of being a strong woman in the public eye, the criticism over her voice, age, and appearance, and the double standard confronting women in politics.<\/p>\n<p>She lays out how the 2016 election was marked by an unprecedented assault on our democracy by a foreign adversary. By analyzing the evidence and connecting the dots, Hillary shows just how dangerous the forces are that shaped the outcome, and why Americans need to understand them to protect our values and our democracy in the future.<\/p><\/ul><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

They decided to leave the city and move to a farm, and start a new, wonderful life where they can care for Esther, rescue other animals and just live happily ever so they thought! People often think about giving it all up and just moving to a farm but as Derek and Steve quickly realized, the realities of being a farmer can be frantic, crazy and even insane. Not only are they adjusting to farm life and dutifully taking care of their pig-daughter Esther but before they knew it their sanctuary grew to as many as forty-two animals, including pigs, sheep, goats, rabbits, chickens, cows, roosters, a peacock, a duck, a horse, a donkey and a turkey.Written with joy and humour and filled with delicious Esther-approved recipes, this charming memoir captures an emotional journey of one little family advocating for animals everywhere.<\/p>\n<p>B\u00eca s\u00e1ch c\u00f3 th\u1ec3 thay \u0111\u1ed5i theo ng\u00e0y xu\u1ea5t b\u1ea3n<\/p><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Beneath a veneer of normal family life, she grew up in and around this all-encompassing secret. Her sexual relationship with her father lasted, off and on, into her twenties. It formed her world, and it formed her deepest fears and desires. Even after she broke away - even as she grew into an independent and adventurous young woman - she continued to seek out new versions of the violence, submission and secrecy she had struggled to leave behind.<br \/><br \/>In this graphic and harrowing memoir, the author revisits her early traumas and their aftermath - not from a clinical distance, but from deep within - to explore the ways in which her father's abuse shaped her, and still does. As a matter of psychic survival, she became both a sexual object and a detached observer, a dutiful daughter and the protector of a dirty secret. And then, years later, she made herself write it down.<br \/><br \/>With lyric concision, in vignettes of almost unbearable intensity, this writer tells a story that is shocking but that will ring true to many other survivors of abuse.

Leaving London to return home to rural South Wales, Robyn finds that it's     her old life  - same teddy bears resting on her pillow, their bodies tucked under the duvet; same view of the garages behind which she'd had her first cigarette and first kiss - but so much has changed. Her dad, the proud, charmingly intelligent, self-made man who made people laugh, is in the grip of early onset Alzheimer's. His brilliant mind, which saw him building power stations and literally bringing light into the lives of others, has succumbed to darkness. As Robyn settles back in the rhythms of life in the rain-soaked vast Welsh valleys, she keeps a diary charting her journey as the dad she knew disappears before her eyes. Lyrical, poignant and with flashes of brilliant humour, My Mad Dad explores how in helping others we can heal ourselves. 'At some point the cared for become the  isn't a shame and it  isn't a tragedy and it isn't a chore. It is an honour.

Covey, bestselling author of The 8th Habit: From Effectiveness to Greatness, comes the accompanying personal workbook that will help you further realize the power of this new habit. The world has changed dramatically since Covey's classic The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People was published. The challenges we all face in our relationships, families, professional lives and communities are of an entirely new order of magnitude. In order to thrive in what Covey calls the new Knowledge Worker Age, we need to build on and move beyond effectiveness -- to greatness. Accessing the higher reaches of human genius and motivation in today's reality requires a whole new habit. The questionnaires, tests, self-assessments, and other exercises in this workbook provide a hands-on approach to developing the mind-set, skill-set and tool-set for achieving greatness in the Knowledge Worker Age. The 8th Habit will transform the way you think about yourself and your purpose in life, about your organization and about humankind.<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

For twenty-five years she had struggled to assert her authority over advisers, who pressed her to marry and settle the succession; now, she was determined not only to\u00a0<em>reign<\/em> but to\u00a0<em>rule<\/em>. In this magisterial biography, John Guy introduces us to a woman who is refreshingly unfamiliar: at once powerful and vulnerable, willful and afraid. We see her confronting challenges at home and abroad: war against France and Spain, revolt in Ireland, an economic crisis that triggers riots in the streets of London, and a conspiracy to place her cousin Mary Queen of Scots on her throne. For a while she is smitten by a much younger man, but can she allow herself to act on that passion and still keep her throne?<\/p>\r\n<p>For the better part of a decade John Guy mined long-overlooked archives, scouring handwritten letters and court documents to sweep away myths and rumors. This prodigious historical detective work has enabled him to reveal, for the first time, the woman behind the polished veneer: determined, prone to fits of jealous rage, wracked by insecurity, often too anxious to sleep alone. At last we hear her in her own voice expressing her own distinctive and surprisingly resonant concerns. Guy writes like a dream, and this combination of groundbreaking research and propulsive narrative puts him in a class of his own<\/p>\r\n<p>\"Significant, forensic and myth-busting, John Guy inspires total confidence in a narrative which is at once pacey and rich in detail.\"\u00a0<em>- <\/em>Anna Whitelock,<em> TLS<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p>\u201cMost historians focus on the early decades, with Elizabeth\u2019s last years acting as a postscript to the beheading of Mary Queen of Scots and the defeat of the Spanish Armada. Guy argues that this period is crucial to understanding a more human side of the smart redhead.\u201d \u2013\u00a0The Economist, Book of the Year<\/p><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

It is at heart a love story of a long and sometimes difficult courtship, and a passion that verges on obsession: that of a writer for another language. For Jhumpa Lahiri, that love was for Italian, which first captivated and capsized her during a trip to Florence after college. Although Lahiri studied Italian for many years afterwards, true mastery had always eluded her.<br \/><br \/>Seeking full immersion, she decided to move to Rome with her family, for `a trial by fire, a sort of baptism' into a new language and world. There, she began to read and to write - initially in her journal - solely in Italian. In Other Words, an autobiographical work written in Italian, investigates the process of learning to express oneself in another language, and describes the journey of a writer seeking a new voice.<br \/><br \/>Presented in a dual-language format, this is a wholly original book about exile, linguistic and otherwise, written with an intensity and clarity not seen since Vladimir Nabokov: a startling act of self-reflection and a provocative exploration of belonging and reinvention.<\/p><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

They cornered him while he was walking home from school, harassed him because they thought he was gay, and poured a jug of gasoline on him. He escaped, but just barely. It wasn't the last time he would face death.Three decades later, Moore is an award-winning writer, a leading Black Lives Matter activist, and an advocate for justice and liberation. In No Ashes in the Fire, he shares the journey taken by that scared, bullied teenager who not only survived, but found his calling. Moore's transcendence over the myriad forces of repression that faced him is a testament to the grace and care of the people who loved him, and to his hometown, Camden, NJ, scarred and ignored but brimming with life. Moore reminds us that liberation is possible if we commit ourselves to fighting for it, and if we dream and create futures where those who survive on society's edges can thrive.No Ashes in the Fire is a story of beauty and hope-and an honest reckoning with family, with place, and with what it means to be free.Lambda Literary Award - Gay Memoir\/Biography (Winner - 2019)A New York Times Notable Book of the Year (2018)<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

When Pauli Murray first saw Eleanor Roosevelt, Pauli was twenty-three living at a government-sponsored, two-hundred-acre camp for unemployed women that the first lady had sponsored for working women and the poor. Eleanor appeared one day unannounced, driving her car with her secretary and a Secret Service agent as her passengers.<\/p>\r\n<p>To Murray, Roosevelt\u2019s self-assurance in that moment was a symbol of women\u2019s independence, a symbol that endured throughout Murray\u2019s life. Five years later, Pauli Murray, a twenty-eight-year-old aspiring writer, wrote a letter to Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt protesting racial segregation in the South. The first lady wrote back. So began a friendship that would last for a quarter of a century, as Pauli went on to co-found the National Organization for Women and Eleanor became the first chair of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.<\/p>\r\n<p>Drawing on letters, journals, diaries, published and unpublished manuscripts, and interviews, Patricia Bell-Scott gives us the first close-up portrait of this evolving relationship and how it changed the cause of American social justice.<\/p><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

For months, Lee outsourced her memories to her notebook. It is from these memories that she has constructed this frank and compelling memoir.<\/p>\n<p>In a precise and captivating narrative, Lee navigates fearlessly between chronologies, weaving her childhood humiliations and joys together with the story of the early days of her marriage; and then later, in painstaking, painful, and unflinching detail, her stroke and every upset, temporary or permanent, that it causes.<\/p>\n<p>Lee processes her stroke and illuminates the connection between memory and identity in an honest, meditative, and truly funny manner, utterly devoid of self-pity.

Raised mostly by his mother with an occasional cameo from his gangster father, Warren had an affinity and talent for music at an early age. Taking to the piano and guitar almost instantly, he began imitating and soon creating songs at every opportunity. After an impromptu performance in the right place at the right time, a record deal landed on the lap of a teenager who was eager to set out on his own and make a name for himself. But of course, where fame is concerned, things are never quite so simple.Drawing on original interviews with those closest to Zevon, including Crystal Zevon, Jackson Browne, Mitch Albom, Danny Goldberg, Barney Hoskyns, and Merle Ginsberg, Nothing's Bad Luck tells the story of one of rock's greatest talents. Journalist C.M. Kushins not only examines Zevon's troubled personal life and sophisticated, ever-changing musical style, but emphasizes the moments in which the two are inseparable, and ultimately paints Zevon as a hot-headed, literary, compelling, musical genius worthy of the same tier as that of Bob Dylan and Neil Young.In Nothing's Bad Luck, Kushins at last gives Warren Zevon the serious, in-depth biographical treatment he deserves, making the life of this complex subject accessible to fans old and new for the very first time.<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

It's not all grim, though: the seaside holiday was born on North Sea beaches, and artists, poets and writers have been as equally inspired by glinting sun on the wave-tops as they have the drama of a winter storm. With a wry eye and a warm coat, Tom Blass travels the edges of the North Sea meeting fishermen, artists, bomb disposal experts, burgermeisters \u2013 and those who have found themselves flung to the sea's perimeters quite by chance. In doing so he attempts to piece together its manifold histories and to reveal truths, half-truths and fictions otherwise submerged...<\/p><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

As a young woman, Leymah Gbowee was broken by the Liberian civil war, a brutal conflict that tore apart her life and claimed the lives of countless relatives and friends. Years of fighting destroyed her country- and shattered Gbowee's girlhood hopes and dreams. As a young mother trapped in a nightmare of domestic abuse, she found the courage to turn her bitterness into action, propelled by her realization that it is women who suffer most during conflicts- and that the power of women working together can create an unstoppable force. In 2003, the passionate and charismatic Gbowee helped organize and then led the Liberian Mass Action for Peace, a coalition of Christian and Muslim women who sat in public protest, confronting Liberia's ruthless president and rebel warlords, and even held a sex strike.

Until now Frida's handwritten letters have only been available to scholars - and recently in Spanish in a book that appeared in 2016.  Now for the first time we have over fifty of these letters in English.And what a treasure. Funny, observant and honest, they chart Kahlo's relationship with her mother; a relationship that was sometimes fraught - as with most mother and daughters - but was always alive and honest.  They begin in 1923 when Kahlo was sixteen and continue until the death of her mother in 1932. These letters tell us about Kahlo's anxieties, her feelings about her husband and friends and above all reveal the marvellous, critical painter's eye in her description of people and places from Mexico, San Francisco and New York. Edited, translated and introduced by Dr. Hector Jaimes, Professor of Spanish, North Carolina State University (who edited the Spanish version) this book is published with paintings and photographs.<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Once abundant in North America, these majestic creatures were hunted to near extinction in the lower 48 states by the 1920s.

Uncommonly powerful, with gray fur and faint black ovals around each eye, O-Six is a kind and merciful leader, a fiercely intelligent fighter, and a doting mother. She is beloved by wolf watchers, particularly renowned naturalist Rick McIntyre, and becomes something of a social media star, with followers around the world.<\/p> \n  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But as she raises her pups and protects her pack, O-Six is challenged on all fronts: by hunters, who compete with wolves for the elk they both prize; by cattle ranchers who are losing livestock and have the ear of politicians; and by other Yellowstone wolves who are vying for control of the park's stunningly beautiful Lamar Valley.<\/p> \n  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These forces collide in&nbsp;<em>American Wolf<\/em>, a riveting multigenerational saga of hardship and triumph that tells a larger story about the ongoing cultural clash in the West--between those fighting for a vanishing way of life and those committed to restoring one of the country's most iconic landscapes.<\/p><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

When she started blogging about her cycle adventures under the alias Lady Velo, a whole world was opened up to her. But it's hard to find space in an industry not traditionally open to women - especially women of colour.Shortly after getting back on two wheels, Jools was diagnosed with depression and then, in her early thirties, hit by a mini-stroke. Yet, through all of these punctures, one constant remained: Jools' love of cycling.In Back in the Frame Jools talks to the other female trailblazers who are disrupting the cycling narrative as well as telling the story of how she overcame her health problems, learned how to cycle her own path and even found a love of Lycra shorts along the way.<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Birth of a New Brain vividly depicts her postpartum bipolar disorder, an unusual type of bipolar disorder and postpartum mood and anxiety disorder.<\/p>\n<p>During her childhood, Harwood grew up close to her father, a brilliant violinist in the Los Angeles Philharmonic who had bipolar disorder. She learned how bipolar disorder could ravage a family, but she never suspected that she'd become mentally ill--until her baby was born.<\/p>\n<p>Harwood wondered if mental health would always be out of her reach. From medications to electroconvulsive therapy, from \"redwood forest baths\" to bibliotherapy, she explored both traditional and unconventional methods of recovery--in-between harrowing psychiatric hospitalizations.<\/p>\n<p>Harwood reveals how she ultimately achieved a stable mood. She discovered that despite having a chronic mood disorder, a new, richer life is possible. Birth of a New Brain is the chronicle of one mother's perseverance, offering hope and grounded advice for those battling mental illness.<\/p><\/ul><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Few people have done more to shape our nation.<\/p>\n<p>A stonemason turned architect turned engineer, Telford invented the modern road, built churches, harbours, canals, docks, the famously vertiginous Pontcysyllte aqueduct in Wales and the dramatic Menai Bridge.

After bonding over beers and a shared passion for education, Gwaxula invited Lief to live with him in the township.

To provide vulnerable children in the townships with what every child deserves-everything.<br \/>Today, their organization, Ubuntu Education Fund, is upending conventional wisdom about how to break the cycle of poverty. Shunning traditional development models, Ubuntu has redefined the concept of scale, focusing on how deeply it can impact each child's life rather than how many it can reach.

A towering presence in the guitar world and one of the most revered rock guitarists of all time, in private he is reclusive and mysterious, retiring and given to esoteric interests. Over the decades he has exchanged few words to the press given the level of his fame, and an abiding interest in the demonic and supernatural has only made the myth more potent.But in the midst of this maelstrom, who was Jimmy Page? Rock journalist Chris Salewicz has conducted numerous interviews with Page over the years and has created the first portrait of the guitarist that can be called definitive, penetrating the shadows that surround him to reveal the fascinating man who dwells within the rock legend.<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

After getting accidentally pregnant in her twenties, she realized that the book she needed - a brutally honest, agenda-less take on the emotional and existential impact of motherhood - didn't exist. So she decided to write it herself.And Now We Have Everything is O'Connell's brave exploration of transitioning into motherhood as a fledgling young adult. With her dark humor and hair-trigger B.S. detector, O'Connell addresses the pervasive imposter syndrome that comes with unplanned pregnancy, the second adolescence of a changing postpartum body, the problem of sex post-baby, the weird push to make \"mom friends,\" and the fascinating strangeness of stepping into a new, not-yet-comfortable identity. Most unforgettably, O'Connell brings us into the delivery room as no writer has before, rendering childbirth in all its feverish gore and glory, and shattering the fantasies of a \"magical\" or \"natural\" experience that warp our expectations and erode maternal self-esteem.Channeling fears and anxieties that are, shockingly, still taboo and often unspoken, And Now We Have Everything is an unflinchingly frank, funny, and intimate motherhood story for our times, about needing to have a baby in order to stop being one yourself.<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

The sale would turn out to be one of the most profitable business deals in American history and the generations that followed enjoyed immense privilege - but they were also haunted by suicides, cancer, alcoholism and mysterious ailments.More than 100 years after that deal was struck, Allie's mother Mary was diagnosed with the same incurable cancer, a disease that had also claimed her own mother's life. Determined to combat what she had come to consider the \"Jell-O curse\" and her looming mortality, Mary began obsessively researching her family's past, determined to understand the origins of her illness and the impact on her life of Jell-O and the traditional American values the company championed. Before she died in 2015, Mary began to send Allie boxes of her research and notes, in the hope that her daughter might write what she could not. JELL-O GIRLS is the liberation of that story.A gripping examination of the dark side of an iconic American product and a moving portrait of the women who lived in the shadow of its fractured fortune, JELL-O GIRLS is a family history, a feminist history and a story of motherhood, love and loss. In crystalline prose Rowbottom considers the roots of trauma not only in her own family but in the American psyche as well, ultimately weaving a story that is deeply personal, as well as deeply connected to the collective female experience.<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

In this same tunnel, a girl had been raped and dismembered. By comparison, Alice was told by police, she was lucky.Though Alice's friends and family try their best to offer understanding and support, in the end it is Alice's formidable spirit which resonates most in these pages.

Then when the Eagles knocked out formidable teams in the Atlanta Falcons and the Minnesota Vikings-both of which had been favorites-even fewer thought they could go up against the dynastic Patriots and emerge victorious. But Doug Pederson, who had bonded with the motley crew of players over the course of the season and taught them how they could work together to flummox any offense and any defense, no matter how formidable, never doubted that his team was up to the task. Taking readers behind the scenes-onto the field where the Eagles practiced religiously and scrutinized weeks worth of tape to identify their opponents' weaknesses and into the locker room where Pederson rallied his players' hopes when they began to question themselves-FEARLESS tells the inspiring story of how one underdog team worked to do the unimaginable: taking down the New England Patriots, who had won more Super Bowls over the past decade and a half than any other team. Distilling Pederson's insights into identifying talent and building a selfless team that puts success first, FEARLESS is the inspiring story of a beloved, audacious group and the making of one of the most memorable seasons in NFL history.<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

He found Roseann lying on the sidewalk and, using a belt as a tourniquet, literally saved her life that day.<\/p>\n<p>Then, Boston police officer Shana Cottone arrived on the scene and began screaming desperately at passing ambulances, all full, before finally commandeering an empty paddy wagon.<\/p>\n<p>Just then a giant appeared, in the form of Boston firefighter Mike Materia, who carefully lifted her into the fetid paddy wagon. He climbed in and held her burned hand all the way to the hospital. Since that day, he hasn't left her side, and today they are planning their life together.Perfect Strangers is about recovery, about choosing joy and human connection over anger and resentment, and most of all, it's about an unlikely but enduring friendship that grew out of the tragedy of Boston's worst day.<\/p><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

In one life, she is a published author and respected scholar who has traveled around the country speaking about Title IX, consent, religion, and sex on college campuses. In the other, she is a victim, a woman who suffered and suffers still because she was stalked by her graduate professor, a renowned Catholic priest, for more than two years. As a doctoral candidate in a world-famous theology department, Freitas loved asking big questions, challenging established theories and sinking her teeth into sacred texts. She felt at home in the library, and safe in the book-lined offices of scholars whom she admired. But during her first year of study, one particular scholar became obsessed with Freitas' academic enthusiasm. He filled her student mailbox with letters and articles. He lurked on the sidewalk outside her apartment. He urged her to accompany him to plays, concerts and summer retreats. He called daily and left nagging voicemails. He befriended her mother and made himself comfortable in her family's home. He wouldn't go away. While his attraction was not overtly sexual, it was undeniably inappropriate and,  most importantly--unwanted. In Consent: A Memoir of Unwanted Attention, Donna Freitas delivers a forensic examination of the years she spent stalked by her professor and uses her nightmarish experience to examine the ways in which we stigmatize, debate and attempt to understand consent today.<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

He has been a pop star with his bands Brinsley Schwarz and Rockpile, a stepson-in-law to Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash, and is the writer behind hits including \"Cruel to Be Kind\" and \"(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding.\" In the past decades, however, he has distinguished himself as an artist who is equally acclaimed for the second act of his career as a tender yet sharp-tongued acoustic balladeer.Biographer Will Birch, who in addition to being a music writer was a drummer and songwriter with The Records, has known Lowe for over forty years and melds Lowe's gift as a witty raconteur with his own authoritative analysis of Lowe's background and the cultural scenes he exemplifies. Lowe's parallel fame as one of the best interviews in the business will contribute to this first look into his life and work-and likely the closest thing fans will get to an autobiography by this notoriously charming cult figure.This is not an authorized biography, but Lowe has given it his spiritual blessing and his management and label are fully on board. Cruel to Be Kind will be the colorful yet serious account of one of the world's most talented and admired musicians.<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

'An autobiography is a book a person writes about his own life and it is usually full of all sorts of boring details. This is not an autobiography. I would never write a history of myself. On the other hand, throughout my young days at school and just afterwards a number of things happened to me that I have never forgotten ' Boy is a funny, insightful and at times grotesque glimpse into the early life of Roald Dahl, one of the world's favourite authors. We discover his experiences of the English public school system, the idyllic paradise of summer holidays in Norway, the pleasures (and pains) of the sweetshop, and how it is that he avoided being a Boazer. This is the unadulterated childhood - sad and funny, macabre and delightful - that inspired Britain's favourite storyteller and also speaks of an age which vanished with the coming of the Second World War. \"A shimmering fabric of his yesterdays, the magic and the hurt\". (Observer). \"As frightening and funny as his fiction\". (The New York Times Book Review). \"Superbly written. A glimpse of a brilliant eccentric\". (New Statesman). Roald Dahl, the brilliant and worldwide acclaimed author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, James and the Giant Peach, Matilda, and many more classics for children, also wrote scores of short stories for adults. These delightfully disturbing tales have often been filmed and were most recently the inspiration for the West End play, Roald Dahl's Twisted Tales by Jeremy Dyson. Roald Dahl's stories continue to make readers shiver today.<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

By the time he was thirteen, Urschel was auditing a college-level calculus course. But when he joined his high school football team, a new interest began to eclipse the thrill he felt in the classroom. Football challenged Urschel in an entirely different way, and he became addicted to the physical contact of the sport. After he accepted a scholarship to play at Penn State, his love of math was rekindled. As a Nittany Lion, he refused to sacrifice one passion for the other. Against the odds, Urschel found a way to manage his double life as a scholar and an athlete. While he was an offensive lineman for the Baltimore Ravens, he simultaneously pursued his PhD in mathematics at MIT.<\/p> \n  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Weaving together two separate narratives, Urschel relives for us the most pivotal moments of his bifurcated life. He explains why, after Penn State was sanctioned for the acts of former coach Jerry Sandusky, he declined offers from prestigious universities and refused to abandon his team. He describes his parents' different influences and their profound effect on him, and he opens up about the correlation between football and CTE and the risks he took for the game he loves. Equally at home discussing Georg Cantor's work on infinities and Bill Belichick's playbook, Urschel reveals how each challenge--whether on the field or in the classroom--has brought him closer to understanding the two different halves of his own life, and how reason and emotion, the mind and the body, are always working together. \"So often, people want to divide the world into two,\" he observes. \"Matter and energy. Wave and particle. Athlete and mathematician. Why can't something (or someone) be both?\"<\/p><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

It examines how people, organisations, and societies can and must transform, how they must `hit refresh' in their\n persistent quest for new energy, new ideas, and continued relevance and renewal. Yet at its core, it's about humans and how\n one of our essential qualities - empathy - will become ever more valuable in a world where technological advancement will\n alter the status quo as never before.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n In addition to his thoughts on these stunning scientific leaps, Satya Nadella discusses his fascinating childhood before\n immigrating to the U.S. and how he learned to lead along the way. He then shares his meditations as sitting CEO - one who\n is mostly unknown following the brainy Bill Gates and energetic Steve Ballmer. He explains how the company rediscovered its\n soul - transforming everything from its culture to its business partnerships to the fiercely competitive landscape of the\n industry itself.

A fascinating read\" (Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook COO and founder of LeanI).<\/p> \n  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Steve Case--a pioneer who made the Internet part of everyday life--was on the leading edge of a revolution in 1985 when he co-founded AOL, the first Internet company to go public and the most successful business of the 1990s. Back then Case was an entrepreneur in an industry that hadn't really been invented yet, but he had a sense how dramatically the Internet would transform business and society. In&nbsp;<em>The Third Wave<\/em>, he uses his insights garnered from nearly four decades of working as an innovator, investor, and businessman to argue the importance of entrepreneurship and to chart a path for future innovators.<\/p> \n  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We are entering, as Case explains, the \"Third Wave\" of the Internet. The first wave saw AOL and other companies lay the foundation for consumers to connect to the Internet. The second wave saw companies like Google and Facebook build on top of the Internet to create search and social networking capabilities, while apps like Snapchat and Instagram leveraged the smartphone revolution. Now, Case argues, we're entering the Third Wave: a period in which entrepreneurs will vastly transform major \"real world\" sectors such as health, education, transportation, energy, and food--and in the process change the way we live our daily lives.<\/p> \n  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Part memoir, part manifesto, and part playbook for the future,&nbsp;<em>The Third Wave<\/em>&nbsp;explains the ways in which newly emerging technology companies will have to rethink their relationships with customers, with competitors, and with governments; and offers advice for how entrepreneurs can make winning business decisions and strategies--and how all of us can make sense of this ever-changing digital age.<\/p><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

The kind of corner that makes me continue road racing. A proper man's corner. You go through the right-hander at something like 170mph, leant right over, eyes fixed as far down the road as I can see.

In this book we'll get inside his head as he stares death in the face, and risks his life in search of the next high. We'll discover what it feels like to survive a 170mph fireball at the TT in 2010, and come back to do it all again. He'll sweep us up in a gritty sort of glory as he slogs it out for a place on the podium, but we'll also see him struggle with the flip side of fame.

Using his background in anthropology, Sebastian Junger argues that the problem lies not with vets or with the trauma they've suffered, but with the society to which they are trying to return.\nOne of the most puzzling things about veterans who experience PTSD is that the majority never even saw combat-and yet they feel deeply alienated and out of place back home. The reason may lie in our natural inclination, as a species, to live in groups of thirty to fifty people who are entirely reliant on one another for safety, comfort and a sense of meaning: in short, the life of a soldier.\nIt is one of the ironies of the modern age that as affluence rises in a society, so do rates of suicide, depression and of course PTSD. In a wealthy society people don't need to cooperate with one another, so they often lead much lonelier lives that lead to psychological distress. There is a way for modern society to reverse this trend, however, and studying how veterans react to coming home may provide a clue to how to do it.

So Lottie finds herself outside MI5's Mayfair headquarters in a dreary suit, feeling naked without her false eyelashes. Miserably assigned to the formidable Dragon, Lottie longs to escape, or for anything to release her from the torment of typing.<\/p> \n<p>Thankfully the serene Arabella is on hand to decode the enigmas of office life - from the strange disappearance of some security films to the career-transforming properties of garlic. But as Lottie's home fills with actors doubling as spies, and Arabella's mother is besieged by fishy telephone calls, Lottie begins to feel well and truly spooked. This unique memoir is a window into 1950s Britain: a country where Russian agents infiltrate the highest echelons, where debutantes are typists and where Englishness is both a nationality and a code of behaviour. Discretion and honour meet secrecy and suspicion in this enchanting, extraordinary and hilarious true story.<\/p><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Cal's narrative is at its heart a father-son story, from his childhood in Scottsville, Kentucky, where business and family were one, to the triumph of reaching the Fortune 300--at the cost of risking that very father\/son relationship. Cal shares how the small-town values with which he was raised helped him guide Dollar General from family enterprise to national powerhouse.Exploring three generations of a successful family with very different leadership styles, Cal Jr. shares a wealth of wisdom from a lifetime on the entrepreneurial front lines. He shows how his grandfather turned a third-grade education into an asset for success. He reveals how his driven father hatched the breakthrough dollar price point strategy and why it worked. And he explains how he found his own leadership style when he took his place at the helm--values-based, people-oriented, and pragmatic. Cal's story provides a riveting look at the family love and drama behind Dollar General's spectacular rise, pays homage to the working-class people whose no-frills needs helped determine its rock-bottom prices, and shares the life and business lessons of one of 20th-century America's most compelling business leaders.<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

The unique and eclectic breed of individuals who freedive at the highest level regularly dive hundreds of feet below the ocean's surface, reaching such depths that their organs compress, light disappears, and one mistake could kill them.Even among freedivers, few have ever gone as deep as Nicholas Mevoli. A handsome young American with an unmatched talent for the sport, Nick was among freediving's brightest stars. He was also an extraordinary individual, one who rebelled against the vapid and commoditized society around him by relentlessly questing for something more meaningful and authentic, whatever the risks. So when Nick Mevoli arrived at Vertical Blue in 2013, the world's premier freediving competition, he was widely expected to challenge records and continue his meteoric rise to stardom. Instead, before the end of that fateful competition Nick Mevoli had died, a victim of the sport that had made him a star, and the very future of free diving was called into question. With unparalleled access and masterfully crafted prose, One Breath tells his unforgettable story, and of the sport which shaped and ultimately destroyed him.<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Born into money (her grandfather invented Listerine), she married into even more money (the Mellon banking and oil fortune) and went on to build, decorate and preside over six luxurious homes in Washington, New York, Paris, Antigua, Cape Cod and Nantucket. She treated her pricy possessions as a casual backdrop to her daily life, including an unframed Van Gogh, \"Green Wheat Fields, Auvers,\" she propped upon her living room fireplace mantel.        <br \/>\n       Bunny Mellon operated in the intersecting arenas of politics, art and fashion, mingling with Presidents, Queens, Duchesses, Hollywood actors, couturiers, artists and  Russian ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin. She was on intimate terms with the giants of her era: when she wanted to deal with lingering childhood insecurities and a difficult marriage, she went into analysis in the 1940's with Carl Jung. Bunny reveled in putting amusing people together, such as giving a small luncheon to introduce Princess Diana and Prince Charles to America's royalty, Jacqueline Onassis and her children, Caroline and John Kennedy. <br \/>\n       An ardent gardener who created the Rose Garden at the behest of her dear friend Jacqueline Kennedy, a savvy art collector, a discerning self-taught decorator who gave advice to her Foxcroft classmate Sister Parish, Bunny became revered for her style and good taste. Everything she did made news: creating a gardening fad for miniature topiaries; giving her blessing to fledgling artists and designers; turning up at her husband Paul Mellon's side to watch his thoroughbred, Arts and Letters, win the Belmont Stakes.<br \/>\n       Yet Bunny Mellon deliberately cultivated an air of mystery. Regal and intimidating, mischievous and effervescent, the soul of discretion, she cherished her ability to wield influence in a quiet behind-the-scenes way, until now. In this illuminating biography, written by bestselling author Meryl Gordon, readers will finally get to know the real Bunny Mellon.<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Was this hubris, or genius?<\/p>\n<p>In How to Turn Down a Billion Dollars, Billy Gallagher takes us inside the rise of one of Silicon Valley's hottest start-ups.

As a flight director in NASA's Mission Control, Kranz witnessed firsthand the making of history. He participated in the space program from the early days of the Mercury program to the last Apollo mission, and beyond. He endured the disastrous first years when rockets blew up and the United States seemed to fall further behind the Soviet Union in the space race. He helped to launch Alan Shepard and John Glenn, then assumed the flight director's role in the Gemini program, which he guided to fruition. With his teammates, he accepted the challenge to carry out President John F. Kennedy's commitment to land a man on the Moon before the end of the 1960s.<\/p> \n  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kranz recounts these thrilling historic events and offers new information about the famous flights. What appeared as nearly flawless missions to the Moon were, in fact, a series of hair-raising near misses.

In this characteristically trenchant memoir, the indomitable Jean Trumpington looks back on her long and remarkable life. The daughter of an officer in the Bengal Lancers and an American heiress, Jean Campbell-Harris was born into a world of considerable privilege, but the Wall Street Crash entirely wiped out her mother's fortune.   At fifteen the young Jean Campbell-Harris was sent to Paris to study but two years later, with the outbreak of the Second World War, she became a land girl. However, she quickly changed direction, joining naval intelligence at Bletchley Park, where she stayed for the rest of the war.

Stephen Moss sets out to master its mysteries, and unlock the secret of its enduring appeal. What, he asks, is the essence of chess? And what will it reveal about his own character along the way? In a witty, accessible style that will delight newcomers and irritate purists, Moss imagines the world as a board and marches across it, offering a mordant report on the world of chess in 64 chapters \u2013 64 of course being the number of squares on the chessboard. He alternates between \u201cblack\u201d chapters \u2013 where he plays, largely uncomprehendingly, in tournaments \u2013 and \u201cwhite\u201d chapters, where he seeks advice from the current crop of grandmasters and delves into the lives of great players of the past. It is both a history of the game and a kind of \u201cZen and the Art of Chess\u201d; a practical guide and a self-help book: Moss's quest to understand chess and become a better player is really an attempt to escape a lifetime of dilettantism. He wants to become an expert at one thing. What will be the consequences when he realises he is doomed to fail? Moss travels to Russia and the US \u2013 hotbeds of chess throughout the 20th century; meets people who knew Bobby Fischer when he was growing up and tries to unravel the enigma of that tortured genius who died in 2008 at the inevitable age of 64; meets Garry Kasparov and Magnus Carlsen, world champions past and present; and keeps bumping into Armenian superstar Levon Aronian in the gents at tournaments. He becomes champion of Surrey, wins tournaments in Chester and Bury St Edmunds, and holds his own at the famous event in the Dutch seaside resort of Wijk aan Zee (until a last-round meltdown), but too often he is beaten by precocious 10-year-olds and finds it hard to resist the urge to punch them. He looks for spiritual fulfilment in the game, but mostly finds mental torture.<\/p><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

In\u00a0First Man, author James R. Hansen explores the life of Neil Armstrong. Based on over fifty hours of interviews with the intensely private Armstrong, who also gave Hansen exclusive access to private documents and family sources, this \u201cmagnificent panorama of the second half of the American twentieth century\u201d (Publishers Weekly, starred review) is an unparalleled biography of an American icon.<br \/><br \/>In this \u201ccompelling and nuanced portrait\u201d (Chicago Tribune) filled with revelations, Hansen vividly recreates Armstrong\u2019s career in flying, from his seventy-eight combat missions as a naval aviator flying over North Korea to his formative trans-atmospheric flights in the rocket-powered X-15 to his piloting Gemini VIII to the first-ever docking in space. For a pilot who cared more about flying to the Moon than he did about walking on it, Hansen asserts, Armstrong\u2019s storied vocation exacted a dear personal toll, paid in kind by his wife and children. For the near-fifty years since the Moon landing, rumors have swirled around Armstrong concerning his dreams of space travel, his religious beliefs, and his private life.<br \/><br \/>A penetrating exploration of American hero worship, Hansen addresses the complex legacy of the First Man, as an astronaut and as an individual. \u201cFirst Man\u00a0burrows deep into Armstrong\u2019s past and present\u2026What emerges is an earnest and brave man\u201d (Houston Chronicle) who will forever be known as history\u2019s most famous space traveler.<\/p><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

They were captivated by the rollercoaster relationship between Chris and girlfriend Olivia and entertained by the bromance that developed between Chris and best pal Kem.But what really makes Chris tick? What made this down-to-earth country lad swap life on the farm with his family for red carpets and newspaper front pages? Chris reveals all about his life before the hit reality TV show and how the crippling anxiety he has suffered from before still haunts him to this day. He shares how he has found fame and adjusted to his new life as well as the things he is learning about himself as his life is put under the spotlight for all to see.With his trademark sense of humour and way with words, this is Chris's take on the world, his life laid bare.<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Mail on SundayA massive audience in sitting-rooms, parks and pubs watched England in the 2018 World Cup. Yet as Duncan Hamilton demonstrates with style, insight and wit in Going to the Match, watching on TV is no substitute for being there. Hamilton embarks on a richly entertaining, exquisitely crafted journey through football. Glory game or grass roots, England v Slovenia or Guiseley v Hartlepool, he delves beneath the action to illuminate the stories which make the sport endlessly compelling.Along the way he marvels at present-day titans Harry Kane, Mo Salah, Kevin De Bruyne and Paul Pogba, reflects on sepia-tinted magicians Stanley Matthews, Jimmy Greaves, Bobby Charlton and Pele, and assesses managerial giants from Brian Clough and Jose Mourinho to Arsene Wenger and Gareth Southgate.The odyssey takes Hamilton from Fleetwood to Berlin, via Glasgow and a Manchester derby, making detours into art, cinema, literature and politics as  he explores the game's ever-changing culture and character.The result, like the L.S. Lowry painting that inspired the book, is a football masterpiece.<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Her parents were known to be a highly glamorous couple: Harold was a famous actor and film director who possessed legendary charm; Bridget was known for her lively sense of humour, fluency in foreign languages and her penchant for giving memorable parties. But in spite of her parents' initial happiness, they parted after the war. Eleven years later they got back together, happily, though each would have a lover for decades. After her education ended prematurely - Bridget didn't believe in university for women - Angela Huth went from reluctant debutante to professional writer, switching from journalism to short stories, novels, plays for television and the stage.Praise for Angela Huth:'A first-class writer' Sunday Telegraph'There is a very strong case for Huth replacing Jane Austen on the school syllabus' Sunday Times'Angela Huth knows her own range and writes within it; she is an excellent exponent of the traditional English social comedy . . . she is in perfect control' Daily Telegraph<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

I will encourage you to find mentors of your own and explain how you may better use the ones you already have. Furthermore, I will tell you about my experiences mentoring others and how invaluable that has been on my ongoing journey to self-acceptance and how it has helped me to transform from a bewildered and volatile vagabond to a (mostly) present and (usually) focussed husband and father.  Could happiness lie in helping others and being open to accepting help yourself?  Mentors - the follow up to Sunday Times number one bestseller, Recovery - describes the benefits of seeking and offering help.  Mentors: How to Help and Be Helped describes the impact that a series of significant people have had on the author - from the wayward youths he tried to emulate growing up in Essex, through the first ex-junkie sage, to the people he turns to today to help him be a better father. It explores how we all - consciously and unconsciously - choose guides, mentors and heroes throughout our lives and examines the new perspectives they can bring.<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

If To Kill a Mockingbird was one of your favorite books growing up, you should add Furious Hours to your reading list today.\u201d \u2014 Southern Living &nbsp; Reverend Willie Maxwell was a rural preacher accused of murdering five of his family members for insurance money in the 1970s. With the help of a savvy lawyer, he escaped justice for years until a relative shot him dead at the funeral of his last victim. Despite hundreds of witnesses, Maxwell\u2019s murderer was acquitted\u2014thanks to the same attorney who had previously defended the Reverend. &nbsp; Sitting in the audience during the vigilante\u2019s trial was Harper Lee, who had traveled from New York City to her native Alabama with the idea of writing her own In Cold Blood, the true-crime classic she had helped her friend Truman Capote research seventeen years earlier. Lee spent a year in town reporting, and many more years working on her own version of the case. &nbsp;Now Casey Cep brings this story to life, from the shocking murders to the courtroom drama to the racial politics of the Deep South. At the same time, she offers a deeply moving portrait of one of the country\u2019s most beloved writers and her struggle with fame, success, and the mystery of artistic creativity.<\/p><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

As Galileo said, `Everything in the universe is written in the language of mathematics', and Wonders Beyond Numbers is your guide to this language.<br \/><br \/>Mathematics is only one part of this rich and varied tale; we meet many fascinating personalities along the way, such as a mathematician who everyone has heard of but who may not have existed; a Greek philosopher who made so many mistakes that many wanted his books destroyed; a mathematical artist who built the largest masonry dome on earth, which builders had previously declared impossible; a world-renowned painter who discovered mathematics and decided he could no longer stand the sight of a brush; and a philosopher who lost his head, but only after he had died.<br \/><br \/>Enriched with tales of colourful personalities and remarkable discoveries, there is also plenty of mathematics for keen readers to get stuck into. Written in Johnny Ball's characteristically light-hearted and engaging style, this book is packed with historical insight and mathematical marvels; join Johnny and uncover the wonders found beyond the numbers.<\/p><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Now settled into the sleepy Yorkshire village of Darrowby, and married to Helen the farmer's daughter, James Herriot thinks he's finally got himself sorted. But life as a vet in the 1930s was never going to be easy. Quite aside from his unpredictable colleagues, brothers Siegfried and Tristan Farnon, he must contend with new-fangled medical techniques, delivering calves after far too much home-made wine, and a grudge-holding dog called Magnus who never forgets. And then, with Britain on the verge of war, James faces a decision that could separate him from Darrowby - and Helen - for ever . . .

She is a farmer's wife and shepherdess, living alongside her husband Clive and seven children at Ravenseat, a 2000 acre sheep hill farm at the head of Swaledale in North Yorkshire. It's a challenging life but one she loves. In The Yorkshire Shepherdess she describes how the rebellious girl from Huddersfield, who always wanted to be a shepherdess, achieved her dreams. Full of amusing anecdotes and unforgettable characters, the book takes us from fitting in with the locals to fitting in motherhood, from the demands of the livestock to the demands of raising a large family in such a rural backwater. Amanda also evokes the peace of winter, when they can be cut off by snow without electricity or running water, the happiness of spring and the lambing season, and the backbreaking tasks of summertime - haymaking and sheepshearing - inspiring us all to look at the countryside and those who work there with new appreciation.<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

But then a conversation with an Army recruiter in her high-school cafeteria changes the course of her life. Hired as a linguist, she quickly has to find a space for herself in the testosterone-filled world of the Army barracks, and has been holding her own until the unthinkable happens: she is raped by a fellow soldier.Struggling with PTSD and commanders who don't trust her story, Dostie finds herself fighting through the isolation of trauma amid the challenges of an unexpected war. What follows is a riveting story of one woman's extraordinary journey to prove her worth, physically and mentally, in a world where the odds are stacked against her.<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Yet it was after seven years of service when Horace found himself face-down on the ground with a gun pointed at his head by a white fellow officer, that he fully understood the racism seething within America's police departments. Using gut-wrenching reportage, on-the-ground research, and personal accounts garnered by interviews with police and government officials around the country, Horace presents an insider's examination of police tactics, which he concludes is an \"archaic system\" built on \"toxic brotherhood.\" Horace dissects some of the nation's most highly publicized police shootings and communities highlighted in the Black Lives Matter movement and beyond to explain how these systems and tactics have had detrimental outcomes to the people they serve. Horace provides fresh analysis on communities experiencing the high killing and imprisonment rates due to racist policing such as Ferguson, New Orleans, Baltimore, and Chicago from a law enforcement point of view and uncovers what has sown the seeds of violence.Timely and provocative, The Black and The Blue sheds light on what truly goes on behind the blue line.<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

This edition contains If Only They Could Talk and It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n Fresh out of Glasgow Veterinary College, to the young James Herriot 1930s Yorkshire seems to offer an idyllic pocket of rural life in a rapidly changing world. But from his erratic new colleagues, brothers Siegfried and Tristan Farnon, to incomprehensible farmers, herds of semi-feral cattle, a pig called Nugent and an overweight Pekingese called Tricki Woo, James finds he is on a learning curve as steep as the hills around him. And when he meets Helen, the beautiful daughter of a local farmer, all the training and experience in the world can't help him . . . Since they were first published, James Herriot's memoirs have sold millions of copies and entranced generations of animal lovers. Charming, funny and touching, All Creatures Great and Small is a heart-warming story of determination, love and companionship from one of Britain's best-loved authors.'I grew up reading James Herriot's books and I'm delighted that thirty years on, they are still every bit as charming, heartwarming and laugh-out-loud funny as they were then' Kate Humble<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Kennedy staunchly advocated for civil rights, education, justice, and peace; his message transcended race, class, and creed, resonating deeply within and across America. He was the leading candidate for the Democratic nomination for the presidency and was expected to run against Republican Richard Nixon in the 1968 presidential election, following in the footsteps of his late brother John. After winning the California presidential primary on June 5, 1968, Robert Kennedy was shot, and he died the following day.

They include Barack Obama, John Lewis, Marian Wright Edelman, Alfre Woodard, Harry Belafonte, Bono, George Clooney, Gloria Steinem, and more.

With a worldwide fanbase and millions of record sales to her name, she should have had the world at her feet. Instead, in the years prior to her passing, she battled with addictions and was often the subject of lurid tabloid headlines. But who was the real Amy? Amy's mother, Janis, knew her in a way that no-one else did. In this warm, poignant and, at times, heartbreaking memoir, she reveals the full story of the daughter she loved. As the world watched the rise of a superstar, then the freefall of an addict to her untimely death, Janis simply saw her Amy, the girl she'd given birth to in 1983; the girl she'd raised and stood by despite her unruly behaviour; the girl whose body she was forced to identify two days after her death - and the girl she's grieved for every day since. Packed with exclusive material that has never been seen before, such as extracts from Amy's teenage diaries, photos and notes, Loving Amy offers a new and intimate perspective on the life and death of the phenomenon that is Amy Winehouse.<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

It is tough terrain, bleak and unforgiving in winter. But it is grand and inspiring, a place where the seasons and unpredictable weather dictate to us every day of our lives, but where the rewards of life far exceed the difficulties. It is the place where my husband Clive and I rear sheep, cattle and, especially, children.  From the bestselling author of The Yorkshire Shepherdess Amanda Owen come more tales of life at Ravenseat, the remote Yorkshire hill farm she shares with husband Clive, eight children and 1,000 sheep.  In A Year in the Life of the Yorkshire Shepherdess she describes the age-old cycles of a farming year and the constant challenges the family faces, from being cut off in winter to tending their flock on some of Yorkshire's highest, bleakest moors - land so inaccessible that in places it can only be reached on foot.  Writing with her trademark warmth and humour, Amanda takes us into her life as nine-year-old Miles gets his first flock, Reuben takes up the flugelhorn and she gives birth to a new baby girl. She is touched by the epic two-day journey of a mother sheep determined to find her lamb and gives a new home to an ageing and neglected horse. Meanwhile Clive is almost arrested on a midnight stakeout to catch a sheep-worrying dog and becomes the object of affection for a randy young bull.  Writing with warmth, humour and a good dose of Yorkshire grit, Amanda Owen and her family have firmly entrenched themselves in the hearts of Waterstones\u2019 readers, she is a particular favourite with our booksellers in her local branch in Huddersfield. Funny, poignant and charming, A Year in the Life of the Yorkshire Shepherdess is a must for anyone interested in the countryside and those who farm it.<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

And while there seems to be an increased awareness related to \"fitness\", more often than not we only think about \"health\" or doctors when we're sick. What's left in the middle of those two extremes is a life-long struggle to stay healthy and productive in a world of mixed medical messages. For the first time, Dr. Radha Gopalan, gifted heart transplant Cardiologist, Acupuncturist and Yoga Teacher, clears up the confusion around health, wellness, and illness. And he does it in a way that will change the way you think about yourself - and medicine - forever. Dr. Gopalan merges his education and experience in both Eastern and Western medicine to look at health and wellness from a unique and powerful perspective and delivers not only concepts and philosophies that can change the way you think about health and wellness, but assesses the most common medical conditions that impact our world - from cancer and diabetes to heart disease, obesity, and chronic illnesses. In Second Opinion, Dr. Gopalan will explain: \"how Eastern and Western medicine can work together for optimum health and wellness?\"<br \/>\n\"how you can influence the outcome of your health - and disease ?\", \" how the five levels of the H-I Triangle shape your personality, reactions, health, and ?happiness ?\", \"how insurance and finances are affecting your healthcare ? \", \"why some people who eat healthy, exercise, and lead a healthy lifestyle still have a heart ?attack ?\", \"how being healthy has more to do with who you must be than what you must do ?\".<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

What made them so spectacularly inventive? Melissa A. Schilling, one of the world's leading experts on innovation, looks at the lives of seven creative geniuses--Albert Einstein, Benjamin Franklin, Elon Musk, Dean Kamen, Nicola Tesla, Curie, and Jobs--to identify the traits and quirks that led them to become breakthrough innovators.<\/p>\n<p>Though all innovators possess incredible intellect, intellect alone does not create a serial innovator. There are other very strong commonalities: for instance, nearly all exhibit very high levels of social detachment. They all have extreme, almost maniacal, faith in their ability to overcome obstacles. And they have a passionate idealism that pushes them to work with intensity even in the face of criticism or failure.<\/p>\n<p>These individual traits would be unlikely to work in isolation--being unconventional without having high levels of confidence and direction, for example, might result in rebellious behavior that does not lead to meaningful innovation.Schilling reveals the science behind the convergence of traits that increases the likelihood of success, and shows us how to nurture and facilitate breakthrough innovation in our own lives.<\/p><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

The sudden death of one of his long-standing team mates made James ponder the unique bond between men who meet each other once a week for years, but don't know any personal details beyond pitch prowess.<br \/>\n Five-a-Side football is where you play the beautiful game for love, not money. You play it for life and you play it everywhere. Your kit is damp and your legs are a leopard's back of bruises. Shirts are often tight around the belly, with your hero's name plastered across your shoulder blades. The showers are too cold in winter and too hot in summer.<br \/>\n Your used sports bag stays unpacked in the hall, and your water bottles are under the kitchen sink. The post-match warm down takes place in the pub. As does the match analysis. By contrast the warm up is non-existent. Your performance is patchy and maybe not what it used to be. But we all still think we played great. Five-a-Side is sporting Karaoke - a time and place to live out our dreams.<br \/>\n This is a book for all of us - school mates, work colleagues, total strangers - bonded by the desire to blast one into the net from two feet away.<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

With an extraordinary comeback in 2016, starting with No. 1 single 'Say You Won't Let Go' and his Platinum album Back From The Edge, Back To The Boy shows the British singer and songwriter reflecting not only on his past but also on his return to the charts, and the phenomenal global success that followed. James shares his struggles with mental health issues which led to drug abuse, and how he dealt with the feelings of intense pressure and loneliness that accompanied his sudden rise to fame. Back to the Boy gives an insight into the life of one of the most exciting musicians of today, and how his experiences are reflected in the raw emotion and passion in his music. This is a story of hope and self-discovery to inspire those who have ever hit rock-bottom and managed to pick themselves up again.<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Bush, the forty-third president of the United States, almost singlehandedly decided to invade Iraq. It was possibly the worst foreign-policy decision ever made by a president. The consequences dominated the Bush Administration and still haunt us today.<\/p>\n<p>In Bush, \u201cAmerica\u2019s greatest living biographer\u201d (George Will), Jean Edward Smith, demonstrates that it was not Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, or Condoleezza Rice, but President Bush himself who took personal control of foreign policy. Bush drew on his deep religious conviction that important foreign-policy decisions were simply a matter of good versus evil. Domestically, he overreacted to 9\/11 and endangered Americans\u2019 civil liberties.<\/p>\n<p>Smith explains that it wasn\u2019t until the financial crisis of 2008 that Bush finally accepted expert advice, something that the \u201cDecider,\u201d as Bush called himself, had previously been unwilling to do. As a result, he authorized decisions that saved the economy from possible collapse, even though some of those decisions violated Bush\u2019s own political philosophy.<\/p>\n<p>Bush is a comprehensive evaluation of the Bush presidency\u2014including Guantanamo, Katrina, No Child Left Behind, and other important topics\u2014that will surely surprise many readers. Controversial, incisive, and compelling, it is thoroughly researched and sure to add to the debate over Bush\u2019s presidential legacy.<\/p><\/ul><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

With her sexually charged, outrageous live shows, Grace soon earned the title of 'Queen of the Gay Discos.' <\/p>\n<p>When she moved to Paris in 1970, the French fashion scene embraced her unusual, androgynous looks and, in addition to cover work, she dominated the runways of designers like Yves St. Laurent and befriended the likes of Giorgio Armani and Karl Lagerfeld. While there, she shared an apartment with Jerry Hall and Jessica Lange and became artist Jean-Paul Goude's muse - he also fathered her son Paulo. (Grace was married twice - to a producer and a bodyguard - and she dated Swedish actor Dolph Lundgren for four years.) <\/p>\n<p>But with the dawn of the '80s came a massive anti-disco movement across the U.S., leading to Grace Jones focusing on more new wave and experimental-based work, putting her 21\/2 octave voice to good use. She is as known for her unique look as she is for her music and has influenced the likes of Lady Gaga, Rihanna and Annie Lennox. In the book, Grace takes us on a journey from her religious upbringing in Jamaica to her heyday in Paris and New York in the 70s and 80s, all the way to present-day London, where she is working on a new album.<\/p><\/ul><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Based on over 50 hours of interviews with the intensely private Armstrong, who also gave Hansen exclusive access to private documents and family sources, this \u201cmagnificent panorama of the second half of the American twentieth century\u201d (Publishers Weekly, Starred Review) is an unparalleled biography of an American icon.<\/p>\n<p>When Apollo 11 touched down on the moon\u2019s surface in 1969, the first man on the moon became a legend. Hansen vividly recreates Armstrong's career in flying, from his seventy-eight combat missions as a naval aviator flying over North Korea to his formative transatmospheric flights in the rocket-powered X-15 to his piloting Gemini VIII to the first-ever docking in space. For a pilot who cared more about flying to the Moon than he did about walking on it, Hansen asserts, Armstrong's storied vocation exacted a dear personal toll, paid in kind by his wife and children. In the years since the Moon landing, rumors swirled around Armstrong concerning his dreams of space travel, his religious beliefs, and his private life.<\/p><\/ul><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Shane Dawson's memoir features twenty original essays-uncensored yet surprisingly sweet. Shane Dawson has always been an open book.<\/p>\n<p>From his first YouTube vlog back in 2008, to his feature film debut \"Not Cool,\" to a cover story in Variety magazine, Shane has documented his life pre-tty thoroughly. We've seen awkward and adorable Q&As with his mum, weight loss center drama, love life details, and the all-important haircut reveal. We've seen his hilarious spoofs of Miley Cyrus, Paris Hilton, and Sarah Palin. His music videos are awesome.<\/p>\n<p>But in I Hate Myselfie, fans will finally get a chance to see the real Shane through personal stories that are at once humorous and heartwarming, self-deprecating and totally inspiring.<\/p>\n<p>Highlighting key moments of his childhood and adolescence, through his phenomenal success on YouTube, and continuing on to his more recent experiences as an actor and director, Shane's memoir will feature the silliness and satire his fans already enjoy, but it will be even more in depth, more real, and more portable (it's a book).<\/p><\/ul><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Learning to play tennis in your fifties is no small feat, but becoming a serious, competitive tennis player at the age of sixty is a whole other matter. It requires training the body to defy age, and to methodically build one's game--the strokework, footwork, strategy, and mental toughness.<\/p>\n<p>Gerry Mazorati had the strong desire to lead an examined physical life, to push his body into the \"encore\" of middle age. In Late to the Ball Mazorati writes vividly about his difficulties, frustrations, and triumphs of becoming a seriously good tennis player. He takes on his quest with complete vigor and absolute determination to see it through, providing a rich, vicarious experience, involving the science of aging, his existential battle with time, and the beautiful, mysterious game of tennis. \"E and clean\" (Publishers Weekly), Late to the Ball is also captivating evidence that the rest of the Baby Boomer generation, now between middle age and old age, can find their own quest and do the same.<\/p><\/ul><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

When I visited New York, I started photographing Patti. I was captivated by her look... tall, thin, with porcelain skin, sharp features, and those piercing eyes.<\/p>\n<p>With me, in terms of portraits, it's always the eyes first, then the rest of the face comes into view.<\/p>\n<p>Patti Smith came to prominence during the punk rock movement in the 1970s, with her highly regarded 1975 debut album, Horses. She has been called -punk rock's poet laureate- because of her feminist sensibilities and intellectual approach to her music.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, she is one of rock and roll's most influential female musicians and according to Rolling Stone, one of -The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.<\/p>\n<p>Among some of Patti Smith's early influences were Robert Mapplethorpe, Jim Carroll, and Tom Verlaine.<\/p>\n<p>She spent the early 1970s painting, writing, and performing spoken-word poetry--frequently at the St. Mark's Poetry Project. By 1974, she was performing as a musician, initially with guitarist and rock archivist Lenny Kaye. The Patti Smith Group produced four albums in the 1970s, reaching #13 on Billboard's Top 100 in 1978 with the single -Because The Night, - cowritten with Smith's friend Bruce Springsteen.<\/p><\/ul><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

All of the men in her town were killed and the women were taken into slavery.<\/p>\n<p>This is Farida Khalaf's story.<\/p>\n<p>In unprecedented detail, Farida describes her world as it was--at nineteen, she was living at home with her brothers and parents, finishing her schooling and looking forward to becoming a math teacher--and the hell it became. Held in a slave market in Syria and sold into the homes of several ISIS soldiers, she stubbornly attempts resistance at every turn. Farida is ultimately brought to an ISIS training camp in the middle of the desert, where she plots an against-all-odds escape for herself and five other girls.<\/p>\n<p>A riveting firsthand account of life in captivity and a courageous flight to freedom, this astonishing memoir is also Farida's way of bearing witness, and of ensuring that ISIS does not succeed in crushing her spirit. Her bravery, resilience, and hope in the face of unimaginable violence will fascinate and inspire.<\/p><\/ul><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

On her second night of college, Aspen was raped by a fellow student.<\/p>\n<p>Overprotected by her parents who discouraged her from telling of the attack, Aspen was confused and ashamed. Dealing with a problem that has sadly become all too common on college campuses around the country, she stumbled through her first semester a challenging time made even harder by the coldness of her college's \"conflict mediation\" process.<\/p>\n<p>Her desperation growing, she made a bold decision: She would seek healing in the freedom of the wild, on the 2,650-mile Pacific Crest Trail leading from Mexico to Canada.<\/p>\n<p>In this inspiring memoir, Aspen chronicles her journey, a five-month trek that was ambitious, dangerous, and transformative. A nineteen-year-old girl alone and lost, she conquered desolate mountain passes and met rattlesnakes, bears, and fellow desert pilgrims.<\/p>\n<p>Exhausted after each thirty-mile day, at times on the verge of starvation, Aspen was forced to confront her numbness, coming to terms with the sexual assault and her parents' disappointing reaction. On the trail and on her own, she found that survival is predicated on persistent self-reliance. She found her strength. After a thousand miles of solitude, she found a man who helped her learn to love and trust again\u2014and heal.<\/p><\/ul><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

In exchange for housing, she would take care of her friend's eight sled dogs. That winter, she learned that she was tougher than she ever knew. She learned how to survive in one of the most remote places on earth and she learned she was strong enough to be alone.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">She fell in love twice: first with running sled dogs, and then with Andy, a gentle man who had himself moved to Alaska to heal a broken heart. Kristin and Andy married and started a sled dog kennel. While this work was enormously satisfying, Kristin became determined to complete the Iditarod - the 1,000-mile dogsled race from Anchorage, in south central Alaska, to Nome on the western Bering Sea coast.THIS MUCH COUNTRY is the story of renewal and transformation. It's about journeying across a wild and unpredictable landscape and finding inner peace, courage and a true home. It's about pushing boundaries and overcoming paralyzing fears.<\/p><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

This omnibus edition comprises of Vets Might Fly and Vet in a Spin. Training as an RAF pilot in the smoke and bustle of London is a far cry from James Herriot's day job as a country vet in the Yorkshire Dales. And while he is keen to serve Queen and country, James cannot help but miss his life in Darrowby - despite frequent arguments between his colleagues, bad-tempered cattle and equally irritable farmers, and the continuing saga of Cedric the flatulent dog. But most of all he misses his wife Helen; pregnant with their first child. The question is constantly hanging over him - will he be going to war? And when will he get to go home? Since they were first published, James Herriot's memoirs have sold millions of copies and entranced generations of animal lovers.

In Pursuit of Love is a riveting read that will give you the confidence to pursue your own purpose and take you on a journey to places you never thought possible. Born and raised in a small Oregon town, all-American girl Rebecca Bender was a varsity athlete and honor roll student with a promising future. Then a predator pretending to be her boyfriend lured her into a web of lies that sent her down a path she never imagined possible.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For nearly six years, Rebecca was sold across the underground world of sex trafficking in Las Vegas. She was branded, beaten, told when to sleep and what to wear, and traded between traffickers. Forced into a dark sisterhood, Rebecca formed bonds with her trafficker and three other women, creating a false sense of family. During that time, God began revealing himself to her. And in the midst of her exploitation, she found the hope she needed to survive. After a federal raid, Rebecca escaped. Her life was forever changed as she felt the embrace of her heavenly Father guiding her to healing and wholeness. Rebecca soon began to use her own experiences to change the lives of others as she went back into the darkest places she had known - assisting FBI, VICE, and law enforcement across the country in some of their most difficult cases. Through Rebecca's incredible story of redemption, we remember that our past does not have to determine our destiny.<\/p><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

This is Bridget Jones Dries Out.Clare Pooley is a Cambridge graduate and was a Managing Partner at one of the world's biggest advertising agencies, and yet by eighteen months ago she'd become an overweight, depressed, middle-aged mother of three who was drinking more than a bottle of wine a day, and spending her evenings Googling 'Am I an alcoholic?'In a desperate bid to turn her life around, she quit drinking and started a blog. She called it Mummy Was a Secret Drinker.This book is the story of a year in Clare's life.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A year that started with her quitting booze having been drinking more than a bottle of wine every day. It sees her starting a hugely successful blog, then getting and beating breast cancer. By the end of the year she is booze free and cancer free, two stone lighter and with a life that is so much richer, healthier and more rewarding than ever before. Sober Diaries is an upbeat, funny and positive look at how to live life to the full. Interwoven within Clare's own very personal and frank story is research and advice, and answers to questions like: How do I know if I'm drinking too much? How will I cope at parties? What do I say to friends and family? How do I cope with cravings? Will I lose weight? What if my partner still drinks? And many more.<\/p><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

With its distinctive, iconic front men, its current-events songs, and its very structure, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young embodied nearly every aspect of their era.The five decades since have seen the band break up, reunite, and splinter again on a regular basis--making for not only some of rock's most indelible music but also one of the its most riveting and ongoing soap operas, a decades-long story of four men whose intertwining lives, music, and careers have transcended music to become the story of the successes and challenges of the boomer generation itself.Featuring new interviews with band members, colleagues, fellow musicians, and former lovers, plus access to unreleased music and documents, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young is the first and most up-to-date narrative biography of this legendary band. From the same author who gave us the acclaimed Fire and Rain: The Beatles, Simon & Garfunkel, James Taylor, CSNY, and the Lost Story of 1970, this book takes readers inside the creative process of albums both finished and abandoned, the inspirations behind the songs and the dust-ups, and the difficulties each man faced along the way. This is the sweeping story of rock's longest-running, most dysfunctional, yet most influential and artistically rewarding musical family.<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Perhaps above all others, Palmer was the reason golf\u2019s popularity exploded, as the King of the links helped define golf\u2019s golden age along with Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to his talent on the golf course, Palmer was a brilliant entrepreneur off it, and one of the first sportsmen to create his own successful marketing brand. Forging an alliance with sports agent Mark McCormick, Palmer parlayed his popularity into lucrative deals, and helped pave the way for the multi-million-dollar contracts that have become standard for stars across all sports. But beyond his business acumen, Palmer was always a larger-than-life character, and Arnie recounts a host of unforgettable anecdotes from a long life in the spotlight.<\/p><\/ul><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

He chronicles his spiritual journey and lifelong belief in Christian Science, and describes travels to far-flung locales such as a scarcely inhabited island in the Indian Ocean where he suffered from delirium and was cared for by the resident tribe.

She moved house every six months, fearing her abusers would hunt her down.

She underwent hours of rigorous police interviews but in the end decided she could not face her abusers in court.<\/p>\n<p>Nonetheless, seven men were convicted of sex offences and jailed as a result of the investigation.

From her incandescent performance as Margo Channing in All About Eve, to her terrifying, psychopathic Jane Hudson in What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?, Davis generated electricity wherever she appeared, whatever she did\u2014and not just on the silver screen. Her personal life was as passionate as her career and was so fiery that it eventually consumed her.<\/p>\n<p>In this landmark biography, Lawrence J. Quirk takes us behind the scenes of all of Davis\u2019s movies, from her early unpromising roles, to her commanding presence at the pinnacle of stardom, to her degrading exploitation in horror films at the end of her career. Quirk delves into Davis\u2019s four unhappy marriages, as well as her frosty, manipulative relationships with her three children.<\/p>\n<p>Also revealed are her many affairs through the years with leading men, bit players, servicemen during World War II, and, very late in her life, much younger men, who repaid her by using her and deserting her. Intense, volatile, ruled often by her emotions, Bette Davis was described by one critic as \"a force of nature that could find no ordinary outlet.\" <\/p><\/ul><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

His signature phrase, \"Let's play two,\" has entered the American lexicon and exemplifies an enthusiasm and optimism that endeared him to fans everywhere.But Banks's public display of good cheer was also a mask that hid a deeply conflicted and complex man. He spent his entire career with the Chicago Cubs, who fielded some of baseball's worst teams, and became one of the greatest players never to reach the World Series. He endured poverty and racism as a young man, and the scorn of Cubs manager Leo Durocher as an aging superstar. Yet Banks smiled through it all, never complaining and never saying a negative word about his circumstances or the people around him.Based on numerous conversations with Banks, and on more than a hundred interviews with family, teammates, friends, and associates--as well as oral histories, court records, and thousands of other documents and sources--Let's Play Two tells Banks's story along with that of the woebegone Cubs teams he played for. This fascinating chronicle features Buck O'Neil, Philip K. Wrigley, the Bleacher Bums, the doomed pennant race of 1969, and much more from a long lost baseball era.<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

With anecdotes sprinkled throughout that involve other close friends and luminaries such as Mick Jagger, Steve Martin, Paul Simon and Mike Nichols - let alone the Pythons themselves - Eric captures a time of tremendous creative output with equal hilarity and heart. In&nbsp;<em>Always Look on the Bright Side of Life<\/em>, named after the song he wrote for&nbsp;<em>Life of Brian<\/em>&nbsp;that has since become the number-one song played at funerals in the UK, he shares the highlights of his life and career with the off-beat humour that has delighted audiences for decades.<\/p> \n  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A legend in his own lunchtime, Eric is the author of many books, some not half bad, some not even a quarter bad. Now he enters his anecdotage as the last word in Python memoirs, and the last of this extraordinary group to tell his story. 2019 marks the fiftieth anniversary of The Pythons, and Eric is celebrating the occasion with this laugh-out-loud memoir, chock-full of behind-the-scenes stories from a high-flying life that features everyone from Princess Leia to the Queen.<\/p><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

In the process, Chozick develops an intimate understanding of what drives Clinton, how she accomplished what no woman had before, and why she ultimately failed.<\/p>\n<p>The results also make Chozick question everything she\u2019d worked so hard for in the first place. Political journalism had failed. The elite world Chozick had tried for years to fit in with had been rebuffed. The less qualified, bombastic man had triumphed (as they always seem to do), and Clinton had retreated to the woods, finally showing the real person Chozick had spent years hoping to see. Illuminating, poignant, laugh-out-loud funny, Chasing Hillary is a campaign book unlike any other that reads like a fast-moving political novel.<\/p><\/ul><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Small-time drug smuggler Thomas McFadden found himself on the inside. Marching Powder is the story of how he navigated this dark world of gangs, drugs and corruption to come out on top.Thomas found himself in a bizarre world, the prison reflecting all that is wrong with South American society. Prisoners have to pay an entrance fee and buy their own cells (the alternative is to sleep outside and die of exposure), prisoners' wives and children often live inside too, high quality cocaine is manufactured and sold from the prison.Thomas ended up making a living by giving backpackers tours of the prison - he became a fixture on the backpacking circuit and was named in the Lonely Planet guide to Bolivia. When he was told that for a bribe of $5000 his sentence could be overturned, it was the many backpackers who'd passed through who sent him the money. Written by lawyer Rusty Young, Marching Powder - sometimes shocking, sometimes funny - is a riveting story of survival.<p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Worried that she was losing her passion for the scientific research she once loved, she was compelled to experience wildness again, to be guided by the sounds of birds and to follow the trails of animals.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In March of 2012 she and her husband set off on a 4,000-mile wilderness journey from the Pacific rainforest to the Alaskan Arctic. Traveling by rowboat, ski, foot, raft, and canoe, they explored northern landscapes so remote there were no maps or guidebooks to mark them. Together, they survived harrowing dangers while also experiencing incredible moments of joy and grace -- migrating birds silhouetted against the moon, the steamy breath of caribou, and the bond that comes from sharing such experiences.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A unique blend of science, adventure, and personal narrative, the book explores the bounds of the physical body and the tenuousness of life in the company of creatures whose daily survival is nothing short of miraculous. It is a journey through the heart, the mind, and some of the wildest places left in North America.In the end, The Sun Is a Compass is a love letter to nature, an inspiring story of endurance, and a beautifully written testament to the resilience of the human spirit<\/p><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

On the brink of a promising future, it instead descended into civil war and conflict. When the 1989 coup brought a hard-line Islamist regime to power, Jamal Mahjoub's family were among those who fled. Almost twenty years later, he returned.<\/p> \n  <p style=\"text-align:justify\">Rediscovering the city in which his formative years were spent, Mahjoub encounters people and places he left behind. The capital contains the key to understanding Sudan's divided, contradictory nature and while exploring Khartoum's present - its changing identity and shifting moods; its wealthy elite and neglected poor - Mahjoub also delves into the country's troubled history. His search for answers evolves into a thoughtful meditation on the meaning of identity, both personal and national.<\/p> \n  <p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>A Line in the River&nbsp;<\/em>combines lyrical and evocative memoir with a nuanced exploration of a country's complex history, politics and religion.

In 1975, Tim Shanahan was a medical instruments salesman living in Chicago and working with a charity that arranged for pro athletes to speak to underprivileged kids.<\/p>\n<p>Muhammad Ali had just reclaimed his title as heavyweight champion of the world by defeating George Foreman (the Rumble in the Jungle ) and then successfully defended it in a rematch against Joe Frazier (the Thrilla in Manila ). When Shanahan learned Ali was planning a move to Chicago, he contacted the Champ to ask whether he would participate in the charity program.<\/p>\n<p>Not only did Ali agree, he invited Shanahan to his new home, where the two spent a night talking, laughing, and bonding over bowls of ice cream the beginning of an incredible friendship. Ali soon enlisted Shanahan as his early morning running partner. Quickly, Shanahan became a trusted confidant and travel companion, and Ali often stunned strangers by introducing Shanahan as his cousin.<\/p>\n<p>The two grew even closer over family dinners with Shanahan s wife, Helga, and Ali s wife, Veronica. Shanahan was with Ali as the Champ trained for his legendary battles with Ken Norton, Earnie Shavers, Leon Spinks, and Larry Holmes, and moved to Los Angeles with Ali when the Champ prepared for a life after boxing. Shanahan was a recipient of and witness to Ali s tremendous generosity, and as Ali s health began to deteriorate, Shanahan had a chance to return the favor, encouraging and comforting his ailing friend. Running with the Champ is an insightful personal portrait of the Greatest of All Time.<\/p>\n<p>But, above all, it is a touching, candid narrative of an extraordinary friendship that continued until Ali's death.\"<\/p><\/ul><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Youssef not only captured his nation\u2019s dissent but stamped it with his own brand of humorous political criticism, in which the Egyptian government became the prime laughing stock.<\/p>\n<p>So potent were Youssef\u2019s skits, jokes, and commentary, the authoritarian government accused him of insulting the Egyptian presidency and Islam. After a six-hour long police interrogation, Youssef was released. While his case was eventually dismissed, his television show was terminated, and Youssef, fearful for his safety, fled his homeland.<\/p>\n<p>In Revolution for Dummies, Youssef recounts his life and offers hysterical riffs on the hypocrisy, instability, and corruption that has long animated Egyptian politics. From the attempted cover-up of the violent clashes in Tahrir Square to the government\u2019s announcement that it had created the world\u2019s first \"AIDS cure\" machine, to the conviction of officials that Youssef was a CIA operative\u2014recruited by Jon Stewart\u2014to bring down the country through sarcasm.

Because he was neglected by academics for so long, and because he made little effort to preserve his legacy, we know very little about Melville, and even less about what he called his \"wicked book.\" Scholars still puzzle over what drove Melville to invent Captain Ahab's mad pursuit of the great white whale.<\/p>\n<p>In Melville in Love Pulitzer Prize-finalist Michael Shelden sheds light on this literary mystery to tell a story of Melville's passionate, obsessive, and clandestine affair with a married woman named Sarah Morewood, whose libertine impulses encouraged and sustained Melville's own.<\/p>\n<p>In his research, Shelden discovered unexplored documents suggesting that, in their shared resistance to the \"iron rule\" of social conformity, Sarah and Melville had forged an illicit and enduring romantic and intellectual bond.<\/p>\n<p>Emboldened by the thrill of courting Sarah in secret, the pleasure of falling in love, and the excitement of spending time with literary luminaries--like Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes and Nathaniel Hawthorne--Melville found the courage to take the leap from light works of adventure to the hugely brilliant, utterly subversive Moby-Dick.<\/p><\/ul><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Shipped from home to home and subject to the whims of various caregivers after his father turned to alcohol and violence, he committed his first crime of breaking and entering when he was ten. His teenage and early adult years were spent drifting, and his petty crime turned increasingly violent, culminating in the terrible events for which he was jailed for life in 1984.<br \/><br \/>Entering prison at 27, James struggled to come to terms with the enormity of his crimes and a future without purpose or hope. Then he met Joan, a prison psychologist, who helped him to confront the painful truth of his past, and to understand how it had shaped him from such a young age. Her sessions transformed his life. Encouraged to read and to educate himself, over the next twenty years Erwin James would go on to receive a BA in History, and become a regular columnist for the\u00a0Guardian.<br \/><br \/>Speaking to the very heart of the human condition, this is a book that offers no excuses \u2013 only the need to understand how we become who we become, and shows that no matter how far a person may fall, redemption is possible with the right kind of help.

Oren\u2019s memoir of his time as Israel\u2019s ambassador to the United States \u2014 a period of transformative change for America and a time of violent upheaval throughout the Middle East \u2014 provides a frank, fascinating look inside the special relationship between America and its closest ally in the region.<\/p>\r\n<p>Michael Oren served as the Israeli ambassador to the United States from 2009 to 2013. An American by birth and a historian by training, Oren arrived at his diplomatic post just as Benjamin Netanyahu, Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton assumed office. During Oren\u2019s tenure in office, Israel and America grappled with the Palestinian peace process, the Arab Spring, and existential threats to Israel posed by international terrorism and the Iranian nuclear program. Forged in the Truman administration, America\u2019s alliance with Israel was subjected to enormous strains, and its future was questioned by commentators in both countries. On more than one occasion, the friendship\u2019s very fabric seemed close to unraveling.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Ally<\/em> is the story of that enduring alliance \u2014 and of its divides \u2014 written from the perspective of a man who treasures his American identity while proudly serving the Jewish State he has come to call home. No one could have been better suited to strengthen bridges between the United States and Israel than Michael Oren \u2014 a man equally at home jumping out of a plane as an Israeli paratrooper and discussing Middle East history on TV\u2019s Sunday morning political shows. In the pages of this fast-paced book, Oren interweaves the story of his personal journey with behind-the-scenes accounts of fateful meetings between President Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, high-stakes summits with the Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, and diplomatic crises that intensified the controversy surrounding the world\u2019s most contested strip of land.<\/p>\r\n<p>A quintessentially American story of a young man who refused to relinquish a dream \u2014 irrespective of the obstacles \u2014 and an inherently Israeli story about assuming onerous responsibilities,\u00a0<em>Ally<\/em> is at once a record, a chronicle, and a confession. And it is a story about love \u2014 about someone fortunate enough to love two countries and to represent one to the other. But, above all, this memoir is a testament to an alliance that was and will remain vital for Americans, Israelis, and the world.<\/p><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

Gawky, socially awkward and totally unqualified, his first reaction to this exciting opportunity was panic. But he'd always been drawn to off-beat characters, so maybe his enthusiasm would carry the day. Or, you know, maybe it wouldn't . . .<\/p> \n  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In Gotta Get Theroux This, Louis takes the reader on a joyous journey from his anxiety-prone childhood to his unexpectedly successful career. Nervously accepting the BBC's offer of his own series, he went on to create an award-winning documentary style that has seen him immersed in the weird worlds of paranoid US militias and secretive pro-wrestlers, get under the skin of celebrities like Max Clifford and Chris Eubank and tackle gang culture in San Quentin prison, all the time wondering whether the same qualities that make him good at documentaries might also make him bad at life.<\/p> \n  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As Louis woos his beautiful wife Nancy and learns how to be a father, he also dares to take on the powerful Church of Scientology. Just as challenging is the revelation that one of his old subjects, Jimmy Savile, was a secret sexual predator, prompting him to question our understanding of how evil takes place. Filled with wry observation and self-deprecating humour, this is Louis at his most insightful and honest best.<\/p> \n  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">______________<\/p> \n  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">'Funny, engaging' - Sunday Times<\/p> \n  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">'Gripping' - Daily Mail<\/p> \n  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">'Absorbing and surprisingly candid' - Telegraph Magazine<\/p><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

In the early 1980s, she worked for Bob Woodward, first as his research assistant in the paper\u2019s investigative unit and, later, as his personal researcher for Veil, his bestselling book about the CIA. Next she helped Carl Bernstein, who was struggling to finish his memoir, Loyalties.<\/p>\n<p>She then assisted legendary editor Ben Bradlee on his acclaimed autobiography A Good Life, and she worked with Hillary Clinton on her bestselling It Takes a Village. Feinman Todd\u2019s involvement with Mrs. Clinton made headlines when the First Lady neglected to acknowledge her role in the book\u2019s creation, and later, when a disclosure to Woodward about the Clinton White House appeared in one of his books.<\/p>\n<p>These events haunted Feinman Todd for the next two decades until she confronted her past and discovered something startling.<\/p>\n<p>Revealing what it\u2019s like to get into the heads and hearts of some of Washington\u2019s most compelling and powerful figures, Feinman Todd offers authentic portraits that go beyond the carefully polished public personas that are the standard fare of the Washington publicity factory.

Garth began writing his napkin notes when Emma was in grade school, and as she grew up, his notes became more meaningful.<\/p>\n<p>Shortly after Emma turned twelve, Garth learned he had kidney cancer. Determined to make the time he has left meaningful, he has compiled years\u2019 worth of notes to get his daughter through her high school graduation. Now, in this moving book, a blend of inspiration and memoir, he makes his remarkable legacy available to all of us, to deepen our relationships with our own children and those we love.<\/p><\/ul><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.

It wasn't the last time his performance would come under fire. But Webb progressed through the ranks, and his natural calm authority made a good impression on players and administrators alike, and soon he was being offered the top matches and the toughest fixtures.<\/p>\n<p>The policeman went on to take charge of some of the most important games, including the 2009 FA Cup final, the 2010 Champions League final and - the biggest of the lot - the 2010 World Cup final.<\/p>\n<p>Now, in this superb and frank memoir, Howard Webb reveals what it is like to be at the heart of the action in modern-day football where every decision can be unpicked by television cameras. He explains how he learned to handle some of the game's superstars.<\/p>\n<p>Refereeing is a hard business, but Webb shows just why he enjoyed it so much and provides fascinating insights into how he dealt with the most challenging situations.<\/p>\n<p>With his unique perspective, and the characteristic honesty and humour he has displayed as a pundit on BT Sport, Webb has written a book, updated for this edition, that reveals the game - and the man himself - in a new light.<\/p><\/ul><p>Gi\u00e1 s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m tr\u00ean Tiki \u0111\u00e3 bao g\u1ed3m thu\u1ebf theo lu\u1eadt hi\u1ec7n h\u00e0nh.
